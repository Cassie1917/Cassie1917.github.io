<div style="font-family:VCR_OSD_MONO; color:#693459;">  Ok, hello everyone..and no, this isn't just a very short chapter.<br><br>See, I'm very bored and on a very intense sugar high right now, so I want
to ask you people a few questions, think of it being satisfying for my own
twisted fan fic author mind.<br><br>Good..still with me or have you left yet?<br><br>See, I've gone through the story, and well am actually very, very surprised
by what I wrote because not one of them to me had the same level of humor
or sarcasm in it.<br><br>Confused? Ok, here's a better explanation. Some chapters had more of a dry
humor, (The entire conversation between Heero and Duo in chapter 9 that had
no action) and some, I was just trying for pure slapstick comedy. (Wufei
choking Duo, Relena with an eggbeater)<br><br>So I need you people to answer a few questions of mine, because one: I need
to know as reference for future chapters and two: I got a "religious" flame
the other day condemning me for well, condemning the bible/religion and
such which I don't really think I deserve. And last but not least, I have
several ideas for chapter 10 and I don't exactly know your preferences to
fill it up for more foolish comedy or my as somebody called in an email:
"cynical wit" ^__^<br><br>Do you readers find any of these pop culture bashings offensive? Like..are
there any Britney Spears, Anna Nicole lovers out there reading this that I
need to be aware of? Because you know I can just turn to say... Jessica
Simpson in the future.<br><br>Between wit and slapstick humor, which is better? Please choose one..don't
say that they'll all fine. At least let me know a number 1 and 2.<br><br>What is your favorite moment in the story? What is the funniest?<br><br>Would anyone mind if I made them out to kiss next chapter? ^__^ hint hint.
Yes, I know that I said this should be slow and gradual, but dammit, I like
some of the readers out there want some action too!<br><br>Not really a question, more like any criticisms to my writing style or
topic. Because you know, I really appreciate this one due to the fact that
I've never written humor before and find it much harder to do than angst.
Anyone mind my style because I kinda do a combination of stream of
consciousness and first person narration that might be unique and confusing
to some of you out there. Especially with the randomness of it all.<br><br>Nothing really...just drop me a line sometimes. I get bored and I like even
numbers.<br><br>Anyway, I will be having this up for a week or two, or until I get a
general consensus on where to go on the next chapter. TOO MANY IDEAS!
Praise me, scream at me, flash me (maybe not), or anything else. Need a
vote here!<br><br>Holy Cow<br><br>Need to go and stare at wall now....the white paint has almost a hypnotic
effect to it...
