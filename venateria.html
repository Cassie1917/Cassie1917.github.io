<b> About Venateria!<p> </b>
Briefly, Venateria is one of the now numerous worker's states which emerged after the apocalyptic UN-Utopian War in the 1960s. We overthrew our semi-feudal expansionist monarchy of Arita in the year 2062, and have since united with our Venaterian comrades who overthrew their monarchies and joined us too! We follow the Marxist-Leninist line now, we call now and forever for all workers of the world to unite, as they did here and now in so many other nations of the great Comintern alliance!!<br> </p>

<b> Aquacities!! :3 </b>
<p>
Aquacities is a community run platform where anyone who has access to the internet can make their own website and be free to express themesleves and talk to other users! Its communally run and owned, its for the users, by the users! Though of course its also run by its own administration which blocks all illegal things and is not simply anarchy. It is a great place for anyone to interact with comrades abroad and in other cities and put themselves, their art and anything else they want for the world to see forever! We promote it here because it is the most popular platform in our country and was made by memebers of the DCSR, and we want to encourage interactivity between diverse people as much as possible! </p>
