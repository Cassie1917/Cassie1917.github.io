<div style="font-family:VCR_OSD_MONO; color:#693459;">  Here's my second story after a long time of having absolutely no story.
Hey, I was very busy and I'm sorry for it! But hopefully, I can finish this
series before.. um....sometime before I die?<br><br><br><br>Summary: Duo is a master chef whose cakes, pies, and all kinds of other
sweets have the power to make anyone fall in love. But challenge comes in
the form of Heero, a food critic who finds nothing satisfying. Thus begins
a battle of will, mind, and stubbornness. Who will admit defeat first? And
is Duo's cooking enough to make even the hardest heart fall in love?<br><br><br><br>
Disclaimer: I don't own them..If I did, well, I'd sell them to crazy, but
very rich fans and earn a few billions. Bill Gates, watch out! Saw this
blind date thingy happen on a show, don't remember the name, but I don't
own it! Oh yes, almost slipped my mind. Britney Spears bashing...sorry.<br><br>
Also, for those of you who read my story before, you'll know that I love
long AU series with any pairing. Also, love to write in first person point
of view for some reason...<br><br><br><br>
Chocolate Covered Autumns<br><br><br><br>Chapter one: The Blind Date From Hell<br><br><br><br>All was quiet and normal in the little dessert shop. Well, as quiet as you
can get with these people anyway, which trust me, is a little bit less
noisy than a Britney Spears concert but is still high up there in the
commotion scale. Ask me how I would know about the Britney Spears thing?
Well, you'll soon find out, along with the rest of them...<br><br>
As I pushed the door open, the little bell on top made the most annoying
noise I've heard since..well, since less than two hours ago actually. God
damn the day that Quatre drooped it up there. &quot;It's a nice touch my foot!&quot;
Just pushing the door open took almost all of my reserved energy and I can
only visualize jumping into my bed with the covers pulled up to my body,
snuggling into the warmth and familiarity that is my bed, floating off to
dreamland. Hopefully, a few beers before that will knock me out all night
and the immense hangover in the morning will make me forget the hell that
was today. Ha, right.. I can just see the gods above me whispering
&quot;nightmares&quot; to each other as they gaze down at me right now.<br><br>
Quatre was the first person to look up from his work and at the sight of
me, a smile literally lit up his face. Sometimes, I wonder why I even
bother to put on Christmas lights in the shop when I can save bundles by
just sticking Quatre's face in the windows and let him beam. Save that
thought for December.<br><br>
&quot;Hey, how did the date..&quot; The words caught in his throat as soon as he saw
my weary expression. At the irritating cheerfulness of his voice, I lifted
my tired and aching head to look at him. Great satisfaction came to me as
he took a few steps back from me. The mop he was attempting to clean the
floor with dropped with a dull thud. Poor guy, no matter how hard he tries,
he fails miserably at cooking, though I've got to give him credit for his
mopping skills. He definitely takes more care than any other workers here,
that's for sure. Take Wufei for example, ask him to mop the floors and
he'll start complaining that it's the onna's work, that is until Relena
comes and slaps him on the head. I love these people to death as if they
were my own family... but right now.. I'm just looking for a kill. Well,
not really, maybe I'll just fire some random people. As the saying goes by
some dead ancient guy, if in pain, share the misery.<br><br>
&quot;Um.. I'll be in the kitchen if anyone needs me...&quot; Quatre stuttered
uneasily and fled instantly. No one noticed his slip though and for once,
no one stopped him, probably because they finally noticed my hands at the
door and the murderous expression directed at all of them...but finally
settling on one single slim figure..<br><br>
&quot;Relena... Will you be a dear and come over here for a sec?&quot; I said with
forced brightness and gave her a reassuring smile, however, that smile
didn't quite reach my eyes as they retained their lethal gaze. Everyone in
the room obviously relaxed except for the figure washing dishes in the
corner whose shoulders automatically tensed. Her eyes slowly turned to look
at me and instantly regretted it.<br><br>
The blonde girl gulped and slowly edged towards the kitchen, stammering
something about helping Quatre, but as she made her way slowly, a pair of
strong hands pushed her forward sternly. Her eyes widened to twice their
original size and with a shocked scream, tripped forward and fell into my
quick, waiting hands. She promptly realized that that was the last place
that she wanted to be at that moment. Smart girl.<br><br>
&quot;What the hell do you think you were doing?&quot; Relena shouted furiously at
the owner of those oh so helpful hands, Wufei, who stood there with a
cheeky smile and with one hand, waved at her happily.<br><br>
&quot;I thought you needed my help!&quot; At Relena's bewildered gaze, he shrugged,
the innocent smile never leaving his features, though it's apparent that he
was very smug for getting his chance at revenge. Relena should know better
than to smack him repeatedly so many times yesterday when he criticized her
apple pie.<br><br>
&quot;And besides, you know that Duo will murder all of us if you escaped. I
mean, giving up yourself for the greater good is always noble. Besides, you
were the one who introduced him to that guy, what's his name.&quot; And with
that, a collective nod came from Quatre, whose head I just noticed, popped
out of the kitchen sometime during the conversation to watch the show.
Sometimes I wonder why I even bother giving them a paycheck. They make my
life way more trouble than it's actually worth.<br><br>
&quot;He's right you know..&quot; Hilde, who also suddenly emerged out of nowhere
harmonized, just as mischievous. Seriously, where do these people come
from? Don't they have to work or something?<br><br>
Knowing that she was trapped, not to mention betrayed as the price for free
entertainment, she looked at them sullenly, promising many pain and deaths
to come in the future to the three merry, smiling faces watching her.
Sighing in defeat, she turned to me.<br><br>
&quot;Fine...I'm so sorry Duo, but you do know that cold-blooded murder is
outlawed in this state..&quot; She looked at me with two pairs of pleading,
almost crying eyes that were of an impossible size. Nice try, but that's
what got me into this aggravating mess, and all sympathy that I may have
had for her faded away as I recalled the previous time she used those eyes
on me..<br><br>
~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
~ ~ ~ ~<br><br><br><br>&quot;Duo, I heard that this guy is a great guy! I'm sure you'll have fun!
Please..for me?&quot; Her eyes widened and tears crept out. My stomach twisted
in knots at her earnest face.<br><br>
&quot;Fine...only because of you. But you seriously owe me!&quot; Do I ever win
against this girl?<br><br>
&quot;Yes! I knew it! I knew you'd agree! He's waiting for you outside!&quot; What
the hell? She just told me about this now!<br><br>
&quot;But..you can't be serious!&quot; That guiltless expression disappeared off her
face like it was never there, and she looked towards me with an all knowing
smirk. Instantly, I felt like a deer trapped in headlights, cursing my own
stupidity to fall for it again.<br><br>
&quot;Now don't keep the poor guy waiting! Go! Have fun!&quot; She shoved me out the
door violently. I never knew that she was so strong! Ignoring my countless
protests and the hands that were tightly gripped on the door for dear life,
she managed to kick me out the door and locked the door behind me.<br><br>
&quot;My little boy is finally growing up,&quot; Her head peeked out the window and
with an exaggerated tenderness, started to wipe away imaginary tears out of
her eyes. &quot;How can I bear to let him go? To think, it all happened so fast.
Just yesterday he was still screaming his head off because he didn't get
the decoder ring in the cereal box. Wait..that was yesterday, never mind
then. Have fun kids! But don't have too much fun! Duo, remember your
curfew!&quot; And with those last words and a few more make-believe tears she
grinned at me and waved happily. I was going to whine some more, but with
the window rudely shut in my face, she wouldn't have heard me anyway, not
that she would have cared.. I think I'm going to mope now..<br><br>
&quot;What the hell just happened? I asked myself, completely mystified at what
just took place in less than twenty seconds. Shaking my head to rid myself
of my astonishment, I heard a gentle voice behind me and as I shifted to
face the owner of that voice, a bouquet of perfect, red roses greeted me. I
was stunned as the bouquet fell into my unsuspecting hands and as I
regarded the flawless petals, the voice continued.<br><br>
&quot;Hello, my name is Chris. Nice to finally meet you&quot;<br><br>
Maybe this wouldn't be so bad after all?<br><br><br><br>~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
~ ~ ~ ~<br><br><br><br>Right....<br><br>
My mind passed quickly over these unwanted memories and suddenly, I felt
the corner of my eyes jumping, twitching at an unbelievable rate. There's
no way in hell that I'm going to be deterred from the pleasure that's
coming to me, not today.<br><br>
&quot;Um..it's illegal in the other states too..&quot; Looking at my pained
appearance, Relena offered helpfully and not without a bit of hopefulness
in her voice.<br><br>
&quot;Do you have any clue the hell I went through today?&quot; Before she can offer
her condolences, I cut her off abruptly and continued.<br><br>
&quot;A nice guy my ass.. &quot;<br><br>
&quot;He brought you roses, and come on, you've got to admit that he's cute!&quot;
Relena threw a grateful glance at Hilde, who all of a sudden, evidently
decided to help her best friend...<br><br>
&quot;Not the smartest move to make, Hilde.&quot; Wufei pulled her back and whispered
to her when my face darkened at her words. Smart guy. They both looked away
and Hilde started to whistle as I extended my undivided attention to them
also. Disregarding Relena's sporadic whimpering, I tightened my fingers
around her arms.<br><br>
&quot;Oh yes..the giddy feeling...that lasted about 10 minutes on the car.&quot;<br><br>
&quot;What happened?&quot; Relena found a sudden interest in my love life again
albeit her well-being, which is in a hazardous situation right now. She
must truly have a death wish in her body somewhere.<br><br>
&quot;Well... He invited me to a concert, the most sought after concert right
now actually.&quot;<br><br>
&quot;Ah..good!&quot; Relena piped up happily, thinking that she's safe now.<br><br>
&quot;Britney Spears..&quot;<br><br>
&quot;Ouch.&quot; Quatre, the only one who has remained silent throughout this entire
ordeal murmured, and everyone in the room grimaced at the recollection of
music videos that were SO overplayed, and the body parts that were SO
familiar to the world now. Wufei mechanically moved into the kitchen and
within five seconds, came out with a tray in his hands, with a hot steaming
cup of coffee on top.<br><br>
&quot;Here. You need this.&quot;<br><br>
Seeing the cup, I lost all my revengeful thoughts for that day. Note... for
that day at least. I loosened my fingers around Relena's struggling arms
and tightened them around the cup appreciatively. I sniffed the rich scent
of my favorite drink lovingly as the warmth slipped from the cup and into
my frozen fingers<br><br>
&quot;Thanks Wu, I knew I can count on you. Unlike someone here.&quot; Glaring at
Relena, I slipped the warm, inviting liquid as it made way down my throat.
The heat helped me relax a bit. Feeling the sympathetic gazes on my back, I
continued.<br><br>
&quot;Yeah, whoever said that girl can sing either needs a mental checkup or
needs to take their eyes off her posterior to actually realize that their
ears are numb. I mean, if she was talented, I might not mind all the
screaming, the 12 year olds wearing way too little clothing advocating
child prostitution, and I might even tolerate..&quot; I choked on my coffee as I
finished my sentence, &quot;actually, no, nothing can make me tolerate his
traveling hands. I mean... the guy needed therapy for his childhood or
whatever that traumatized him! He was a leech!&quot;<br><br>
By this time, Quatre has gotten me a blanket from the back storage room to
wrap around my body, Wufei has accommodatingly taken another trip into the
kitchen and this time, the prize he found was a warm cherry pie that I'm
currently wolfing down. Relena, to redeem herself, was rubbing comforting
circles on my back and a foot away. And there was Hilde, completely in her
element, listening to me with concern and nodding at all the right parts to
demonstrate her loyal compassion for my night of torture.<br><br>
&quot;The night was worse!&quot; I complained to my friends. It's quite funny how I
was thinking of killing them just a moment ago. Yeah...we have a weird
relationship.<br><br>
&quot;He took me back to his place.&quot; At that, everyone stared at me, captivated
by my story. I've noticed something about society today..everyone loves to
hear another's pity story so that they can feel better about themselves.
Well, I want that pity right now.<br><br>
&quot;And well, just as he was making his move, and me trying desperately trying
to push him away..&quot; It was completely silent in that room for once as
everyone held their breath for a few seconds, silently urging me on with my
story.<br><br>
&quot;What happened?&quot; Quatre asked, eager to hear more of my terrible night.
See, this is always what happens. I always get set up with some random guy,
and these people wait for me after each date to hear my disaster. It never
fails... I think this is their &quot;entertainment night&quot; for each week. Love to
know that I'm loved... I am starting to have a sinking suspicion that these
people set me up with every weirdo on the planet just to hear about my
date. I can actually picture Wufei going into a hospital, riding the
elevator to the mentally unstable.and giving them each my phone number. How
else can you explain it?<br><br>
&quot;The door opened and his mom appeared.&quot; Wow, this story must be better than
my usual ones. At this far into my narration, they all looked at me
unbelievingly.<br><br>
&quot;You're kidding!&quot; Relena started to crack a smile slowly as she realized
that I was almost to the climax of my story. Shooting a glare at her to
assure that I wasn't kidding...no matter how much I wish I was, she tried
to go back to her &quot;I'm so concerned and serious&quot; façade, but it wasn't
working for her at all. She looked like she was squirming as she was
battling between laughing and somberness. One will kill her, and one will
save her, that's all I can say.<br><br>
By this time, the cup and the plate were completely clean albeit a few
crumbs. I placed it next to me longingly, remembering all the
delightfulness they granted me in my time of distress. My eyes moved
grudgingly away from the plates when a polite cough from someone distracted
me from my pleasant memories. Ah, they were so good to me.<br><br>
&quot;His mom came in..just when he was trying to literally climb onto me, and
when I was about to open a can of whoop ass.. I was shocked to say the
least and felt so humiliated! You guys know that it takes a lot to make me
feel like a fool, but seeing this 5 foot old lady looking down at us on the
sofa in very um.. compromising positions is not on my top list of things to
do.&quot; After attempting to glare at Hilde who I distinctly heard a giggle
from, I sighed in defeat after my glare did nothing but fueled her
laughter.<br><br>
&quot;That wasn't the worse of it. It was what she said after she saw us.&quot; Oh
dear, this is probably one of those memories that will burn into my mind.
I'm sure that I'll continuously have nightmares about this until my
permanent residence is in a rocking chair.<br><br>
&quot;She came in with a handful of clothes and said to him: &quot;I just washed
these for you, and I also made your bed, but before you two get that sofa
dirty, put a sheet on it.&quot;&quot;<br><br>
The room seriously exploded as the sounds of laughter surrounded me. My
hands were covering my blushing face and my mind going through all the
reason why I didn't become a priest. I can almost feel my head expanding as
sounds of laughter made their way into my frustrated ears.<br><br>
&quot;ARE YOU PEOPLE DONE YET??!&quot;<br><br>
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!<br><br>
Apparently not...<br><br>
After quite a while, and quite a few reason of becoming celibate, the
racket around me lessened and I can actually hear myself think.<br><br>
&quot;Shut up!&quot; My voice growled impatiently, not without a hint of desperation.<br><br><br><br>&quot;I'm so sorry, but I mean..you've got to see that this is funny.&quot; Wufei,
laughing hysterically still, had to hold on to a chair for support as he
choked on his words.<br><br>
&quot;Actually...I don't see how this is funny. I mean...an old lady thought I
was going to have sex with her son! She was probably going to watch too to
make sure that we were doing it right if I didn't flee out of there at that
sec!&quot;<br><br>
&quot;Exactly!&quot; Relena squeezed out as she collapsed into Quatre, leaning onto
him as they both hooted at my expense. Her hands were on her sides to
prevent the pain that will surely come with such a laugh. I looked
pathetically to Hilde for help, only to find a body propped onto my
shoulder with the back shaking helplessly..from giggles that is.<br><br>
&quot;Five more seconds and you're all fired.&quot; I said softly in a serious tone,
and within an instant, everyone's back straightened and an equally solemn
expression came over all their faces.<br><br>
&quot;Good..&quot; And just as I was pleased with the proof that I may still have
some little power over my employees, their faces twisted into very awkward
expressions as they wrestled the temptation to laugh. Well, you can guess
who won when a collective laughter made its way to my ears again.
Priesthood..<br><br>
The next employee satisfaction survey is going to be thrown into the
fireplace with me dancing next to it..<br><br>
Finally noticing my misery after they calmed down, sympathetic looks were
tossed in my way again. Wufei coughed as he realized his rudeness. &quot;I'm
sorry, but um..I couldn't help myself. It will not happen again.&quot; And as
those words escaped his mouth, the both of us knew that it would. This is
the way my life goes...<br><br>
&quot;I'm so sorry!&quot; Relena, after a long pause in acknowledging just what hell
I was put through because of her, rushed forward and gave me a great big
hug.<br><br>
&quot;I will never do that again!&quot; She exclaimed determinedly. Well, at least I
got something good out of all this..<br><br>
&quot;I promise I'll do better next time!&quot;<br><br>
Wha?<br><br>
&quot;In fact, I know of a guy right now. He's name is John and I know you'll
love him!&quot; And with that, the arms that were around my neck withdrew
swiftly, making me doubt that her arms were around me in the first place.
She rushed to the phone and like a maniac, started to press buttons
excitedly like she has the phone number memorized..she probably does. &quot;I'll
call him right now! He would love to meet you!&quot;<br><br>
I blinked.<br><br>
&quot;RELENA!!!&quot;<br><br>
The entire room shook with the force of my scream. The comforting blanket
slipped off my body as I chased after her, all drowsiness forgotten as I
tried to stop her hands.<br><br>
&quot;STOP RIGHT NOW!!&quot;<br><br>
&quot;Hello, is this John? This is Relena calling. You know that guy I told you
about?&quot;<br><br>
She jumped over a chair nimbly and pushed it in my direction, temporarily
preventing me from choking her as she talked to the other voice in the
phone in a rushed voice. I hate whoever brought this mobile phone.<br><br>
&quot;RELENA!!&quot;<br><br>
Ouch! Now she's done it. Nobody messes with my braid! Not to mention
jamming it into the closet door. Damn! She's quick. By the time I got my
maltreated braid out of the door, she already took sanctuary behind a
reluctant Wufei.<br><br>
&quot;Yeah, he's so eager to meet you. In fact, he's over here right now,
screaming at me to set a date!&quot; With a few giggles, she raced around Wufei
and Hilde, both already accustomed to these phenomenons. They didn't even
blink an eye when she picked up the phone, or when I picked up a spatula
and started to fence with the eggbeater she had in her hands. Hey, they
were right there and I've always been taught to be resourceful.
Unfortunately, she was every bit, if not even more inventive than I was.
Like I said, not normal...<br><br>
&quot;Yeah, tomorrow will be fine, pick him up at 6, sure, I'll tell him that.
Come to the phone? Oh no, he's a bit shy. Don't worry, it's alright.&quot;<br><br>
And with that, she hung up. The eggbeater was still waving in her other
hand as she battled with me fiercely, dropping the neglected phone on the
counter as she blocked one of my moves to return a nasty one of her own.<br><br>
&quot;YOU LITTLE...!&quot;<br><br>
&quot;Duo, enough with the childishness, you have a date tomorrow!&quot; Wufei called
out in the corner while stacking the chairs up, not even looking back to
the scene manifesting behind him. I swear that he was snickering when he
said that. What happened to &quot;I'll never do it again?&quot; He's next on my
list... but first, there's this agile blonde with a smile I would love to
wipe off her face...<br><br>
Relena is going to pay though it doesn't look like it right now! I tried to
grab her wrist, but she hastily jumped out of my way and landed onto one of
the tabletops, still swinging that eggbeater like a lunatic, but a very
skilled lunatic. However, I wasn't any less vicious with my spatula
countering her every attack, meanwhile, testing every single colorful
adjectives that I've learnt during my youth on her.<br><br>
Ding Ding...<br><br>
Trowa came in with an empty trashcan in his hands, looking at us
skeptically with one visible eyebrow high up on his forehead. We all turned
our attention to him and froze in place. Relena was on the table, with an
eggbeater in her hand that was less than six inches from my vulnerable face
if there wasn't a spatula blocking its treacherous path of destruction.
Then there I was, left hand wrapped around the ankle of my ruthless
attacker, and the other gripped onto the spatula for dear life. Wufei,
Hilde, and Quatre were looking completely natural setting up the chairs and
washing the dishes. I can only imagine what we look like...wait, scratch
that thought.<br><br>
&quot;Another date?&quot;<br><br>
And with that question, Trowa walked past the wreckage that was once a
dessert shop and coolly poured himself a cup of coffee from the kitchen.
Walking up to us leisurely, who were still frozen in place regarding him,
he proceeded to sit down on the publicly acknowledged most comfortable
cushioned chair.<br><br><br><br>&quot;Alright, spill.&quot;
