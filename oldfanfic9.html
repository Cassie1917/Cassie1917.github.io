<div style="font-family:VCR_OSD_MONO; color:#693459;">  Several people have remarked on how "Duo's Christmas Wish" is very deep and
well, unexpected. What can I say? Oops? See, I finally had the chance to
reread every single of my chapter one after the other continuously and
suddenly realized that the Duo I've put on paper seemed too much like a
hormonal driven obsessive.. well, you get the point. So, during a momentary
lapse, I decided to put in this little passage to one: give him more depth
and to prove that he was capable of doing other things than cooking and
drooling. Two: It was to prove how much he loves...big capitalize LOVES to
cook. I mean, I can't cook for the life of me, but I can make him sound
like he knows what he's doing, can't I?<br><br>
For those who are slightly put off by the deepness and pensiveness of that
whole thing, I promise that the humor in what's to come will definitely
make up for it or more. Of course, when we really get to know Heero other
than the person who might, or might not be interested at Duo, there might
be something that I'll do to define his character too. I'm sorry! I just
can't have like, underdeveloped main characters! Seriously, if you're
interested, look at my other story and see what I mean. So much angst and
mood swings that I don't know what I was on. But hey, I liked how I
portrayed Heero in that.<br><br>
OH YES! THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU! You like my story! I don't have
much time to look at the reviews or go on ff.net now but the last time I
checked, I was over 100 reviews! More than I expected ^___^ thank you to
all the reviewers and rest assured, I will get the time to reply to you
people in an upcoming chapter.<br><br>
Warning: Bashing of popular culture...again. No one should really be
surprised. Also, the fact that you're reading a Christmas story in February
is some indication of my lack of time. So sorry!<br><br>
Chocolate Covered Autumns<br><br>
Chapter 9 A Very Duo Christmas Part 2<br><br>
"You ok buddy?" Looking forward from my current station from behind the
trunk of the heavy tree, I watched as a way too quiet Heero struggled with
a patch of green needles and seemingly losing the battle. The forces of
nature against Heero, I really don't think we need to go there.<br><br>
"...." No sounds, not even a peep was heard from the figure in front of me,
dragging the tip of the tree as we toiled to get it into the truck I've
borrowed for just an occasion. Is he mad that he's forced to do this after
the cotton ball man declared us the complete manifestation of all that is
tasteless? I am seriously starting to wonder about that guy and his concept
of beauty and such. When we were leaving, and without an offer to help from
the bastard might I add, he was gently caressing the rejected tree's naked
branches, whispering words of endearment and comfort. I heard something
about "big ignorant tasteless men hurting feelings" before I literally
dragged Heero out of there with me.<br><br>
"Heero? Why are you so quiet?" To tell the truth, it's a bit unnerving to
see such a pensive and quiet Heero, even worse than the usual pensive and
anti-social Heero who chirps in once and awhile to insult my intelligence
or cooking.<br><br>
"I'm going to have to resort to drastic measures if you don't open that
mouth of yours soon!" My eyes were twitching at the absolute silence that
surrounded us. I hate the dark and I hate silence when I'm in the darkness
because that just makes it the second most terrible combination after being
hungry in the silence of the darkness. Trying desperately to fill the
emptiness with my own loud and aggravating voice, I ignored the franticly
shaking head of Heero. If he wants me to stop, he can use something normal
people call speaking up..<br><br>
"JINGLE BELLS! JINGLE BELLS! JINGLE ALL THE WAY! OH WHAT FUN IT IS TO
DASH..." I can tell you right now, my singing can wake the dead if I really
tried. This apparently isn't one of those times because from what I can
tell, Heero merely tensed and quickened his steps. Well, if that didn't
work...<br><br>
"Heero, have I ever told you what wonderful eyes you have, and how pretty
it would look.. I don't know...accompanied by nothing but a pair of boxers?
Even more so after I rip them off with my teeth slowly...and gently..."<br><br>
Mentally inserting welcoming images and evil giggles here.<br><br>
"I mean it's so cold and lonely in the dark right now and I'm sure that I
can find several ways to warm you up quite nicely if you'd only ask."<br><br>
Still no coherent sound besides for the slight protests of a man in pain.<br><br>
"Chocolate syrup, handcuffs and maybe a blindfold?! Brilliant! Wow Heero, I
never thought you had it in you..." I was enjoying this slight advantage I
have with Mr. Mysterious and by using the sultriest voice I can muster up
with laughter just threatening to overspill in my throat, I felt so
deviously wanton. Of course, this spontaneous plan also has its
disadvantages, and one of them is currently making a tent in my jeans from
the disguised truth in my joking exterior. Here goes one for the mother
load, whatever that means.<br><br>
"Never knew you were so adventurous... mmmm, I like this new side of you. I
am Heero, all man and sex walking on two feet, do hear me roar!" Barely
able to squeeze the last sentence out with the same heated tone, I would
have collapsed in laughter if not for the tree on my shaking shoulders.<br><br>
"Dammit Baka! I can't talk becau.mmm the needles get in my mou...mmm."
Oops, I should have noticed that he was hidden in the branches. Oy.. at
least his current preoccupied state will grantee that he wouldn't be able
to come and choke me right now. Wait..Instant light bulb!<br><br>
"Hey, Heero, are you doing anything this Christmas Eve?" I purposely did
not look towards him, or make it known that I heard him the first time
about the branches getting in the way of his speech.<br><br>
More sounds of a man struggling with his doomed fate despite the hands of
destiny, or in this case, branches deterring his determination.<br><br>
"By your silence, I will assume that you're not doing anything. That does
it then! No one should spend Christmas Eve with no plans. You're coming to
my party!"<br><br>
Once again, I was met with silence other than a few muffled sounds that I
couldn't make out, or tried not to.<br><br>
"It's settled then!" I said in a mischievous tone and turned around to bask
in the calming stillness that engulfed us. It was such a lovely night...<br><br>
"muuuuuuuufffffmmmmm!"<br><br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br><br>
"Dammit! This chef insisted on taking me on a tour of his entire kitchen!"
A subtly apologetic Heero said as he stepped into the doorway of A Little
Piece of Heaven, cheeks flushed from the attacks of the chilling air
outside in the streets. It was around 9 at night and we looked up from our
stations on the couch or in the kitchen drinking spiked eggnog, just in
time to see his obvious annoyance. As usual, a bad day turned good as soon
as I saw him, and yes, I was having a very bad day..<br><br>
"Not to mention the 20 chefs that happened to be in the kitchen."<br><br>
"No problem, we don't mind." I said calmly with a cheeky wave towards his
direction while mentally damning Hilde's ancestors to hell for her sniggers
at my statement. Ok, fine, I admit it...I was in complete shambles as soon
as the clock hit 6 and no image of a messy haired Adonis was sighted
anywhere near. I screamed, I cried, I committed suicide... there, happy?
Ok, maybe it wasn't that bad, but it was hell for anyone who was around me
at that time.<br><br>
See, this really wasn't my idea of an ideal Christmas. Usually, Quatre and
Trowa would disappear during the middle, say when we're all enjoying our
presents, and would be found the next morning drunk and tied together with
the ribbons used for decorating presents. Unfortunately, that's
traditionally the only thing that is on them and usually fails to
strategically cover their unmentionables. We always have to draw straws to
pick the victim who finds the source of the snores. But when this happens,
at least I have Wufei, Hilde, and Relena to support my sanity and the
party's livelihood. Well, as we all know, that changed this year. I haven't
seen Wufei for around two minutes and Relena has long disappeared. Wufei's
little train that previously couldn't obviously discovered his dormant
skills with Relena's tracks this year.... so to speak.<br><br>
I don't even want to think about the noises I'm hearing behind that tree
right now.<br><br>
"Why would you work on Christmas Eve?" A curious Hilde asked as Heero
winced and shifted his attention shiftily when various uncensored body
parts were spotted sporadically between the branches of our artistically
decorated tree.<br><br>
"Don't mind them; they're um..enjoying their Christmas together. Let's move
to the other side of the room. Please." She said with slight desperation in
her plea. I can tell this is getting to her too, being also a singleton.
Yes, Bridget Jones is our goddess and we worship the ground that she walks
on.<br><br>
"Well, I'm usually the only one willing to work during Christmas while the
others are enjoying their day off. And many chefs would like this
opportunity to display their Christmas spreads."<br><br>
"Ah, that's a shame, because if you came earlier, you would actually see a
party." The sarcasm dripping in my voice, I stared venomously at the back
closet where giggles were heard.<br><br>
"I would say that this is enough of a party for me.." Dry humor embellished
Heero's words as he followed my train of thought, obviously catching that
loud groan from the closet also. The phone rang in perfect concord at that
moment and thankfully hid some of the four letter words I should never have
heard from sweet Quatre's mouth, especially directed to Trowa in that
matter. I'm praying that "big boy" referred to Trowa's height.. and had
absolutely no references to where the sun doesn't shine.<br><br>
"Don't worry, I'll get it." Said an eager Hilde, probably loving the fact
that her family will provide some sort of a normal gathering for her after
this fiasco. You think if I begged and offered a raise, she'd let me go
with her?<br><br>
Probably not...<br><br>
"Oh yes Trowa, bend!"<br><br>
Meeting Heero's amused gaze, I made a cutting gesture across my neck and
pointed to behind the tree, earning a smirk from him and a concurring nod.<br><br>
"And here I thought you were the dominating one of the two, Trowa!" I
screamed cheerfully, stopping all rustles behind the needles for a second.<br><br>
"Or can big boy not handle it?" Compared to my sassy tone, Heero's words
were less playful, filled with more sarcasm and subtle humor. A shocked and
seemingly scandalized gasp was heard that was noticeably Quatre. Needless
to say, that earned both of us a chuckle.<br><br>
"Heero..."<br><br>
A deadly and cold voice that was distinctly but rarely Hilde stopped us in
the middle of our merry making. It would have scared the crap out of me if
not for the fact that it was directed to Heero.<br><br>
"What?" Seeming defensive to whatever accusation Hilde was about to make on
his part, Heero looked guardedly towards the girl standing tall at a mere 5
foot with her hands on her sides, looking exactly like a disappointed
mother.<br><br>
"Remember Tommy?" The grimace from both of us automatically answered her
question.<br><br>
"Well, I'm not exactly sure but due to some story that and I quote, "a big
bad man" told him, Tommy is afraid of Santa, the only name that can
supposedly stop his trouble making for more than a few minutes. Do you know
how unhappy his parents are that he wouldn't go near the tree and refuses
to come out of his room?"<br><br>
Wow, I didn't think Heero's threat was that bad. Of course, I never did ask
him specifically what he said. The same thing evidently occurred to Hilde
also as she glanced warily at said man.<br><br>
"What exactly did you tell him about Santa? All I heard was something about
reality shows and such through the phone. The poor woman was hysterical."<br><br>
We were both a little put off by the uncharacteristically wicked smirk that
slowly found its way to Heero's face, meanwhile creating uproar in my lower
hemisphere. An involuntary whimper escaped my lips... it was an
unquestionably naughty smile..<br><br>
"Not exactly..."<br><br>
"What then?" The annoyance that crept into Hilde's voice at his hesitation
was created more due to curious irritation than any actual consideration
for Tommy. We'd strangle the kid if we could.<br><br>
"I just told him that Santa had a spare job on the other 364 days which
he's not busy." If likely, his smirk got even wider and sinister. That was
when all the groaning behind closet doors and trees failed to hide my own
whimpers and my effort to slowly conceal myself behind a fern of an ideal
height.<br><br>
"Heero, if you don't finish, I am going to grab you and kick you into next
week." Both Hilde and I were seriously annoyed but for different reasons
which I'm thankful no one besides for me, myself and I know.. and maybe the
fern.<br><br>
"Fine! I told Tommy that he also dresses in drag on his free days and was a
stand in double for Anna Nicole."<br><br>
Oh my dear God and my fellow demented souls.. that was cruel.<br><br>
I've found my soul mate at last...<br><br>
"You didn't!" A panic-stricken Hilde glanced at Heero, not being as
appreciative of the story as I was. Under our amused glances, her
expression turned from shock, to disbelief and finally, to lethal. That
gaze has got to be the equivalent of the most successful cold shower I've
ever been forced to have.<br><br>
"Well then, you're going to deal with the consequences." Her voice left no
room for debate or protests. I looked towards Heero in pity and knew
without a doubt that I would not like to be in his shoes at the moment. A
determined Hilde at times is worse than a frenzied Relena.<br><br>
"And Duo, since you seemed so admiring of his actions, you're going to help
him."<br><br>
I gulped and mentally wrote my last will and testament while it became
Heero's turn to look at me with compassion. Glancing at the mutual fear
that was evident in both our eyes, we instinctively took our iced drinks
and in quick strides, poured them behind the tree without looking at things
that were definitely not taught in the bible.<br><br>
It at least stopped the clapping and whistling for a while.<br><br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br><br>
On the way to Tommy's house, Hilde instructed us to gather some supplies
and along with each stop, I can almost literally hear both Heero's heart
and mine sink deeper into our stomachs. You might joke about how two grown
man is afraid of a little girl, but then I would invite you into this car
and take a look at the torture devices that our sadistic little tyrant has
collected.<br><br>
A Santa costume, several oversized pillows, a large plain pillow bag, and
the cream to top this all off, white wigs and beard. Let the wheels turn,
baby and see what your genius minds can conjure up.<br><br>
No...it's not that we're going to a holiday strip club or a fancy costume
party. Trust me, I've asked.<br><br>
The car finally rested at a two story house painted in sunny yellow and
surrounded by a perfect lawn. I wondered if anyone would be surprised if
within an hour, a naked guy runs out while stripping himself of his jolly
old red suit. No matter, if we're reduced to that, then it will probably be
the best action that these mundane neighbors have seen in years.<br><br>
And if it's Heero, then guess who will be attempting to tackle him?<br><br>
But enough with the joking and let's consider the seriousness here. You
think that these neighbors would be considerate enough to lend a hiding
place for two nice men? Preferably for the next few years?<br><br>
"Ok, now between you two, decide who will get to wear the pants in the
relationship."<br><br>
No pun intended? Sure..<br><br>
Heero looked at me and I stared at him, neither willing to surrender the
hard earned dignity painstakingly gathered after the embarrassment that is
high school crushes and college parties that regained somberness in another
room, another dormitory, another college that was in another state.<br><br>
Ok, maybe it's just because I don't want to look fat, but hey, dignity
comes second.<br><br>
"You do it." Heero said firmly, more of a statement than an actual request.
Nothing can get me to do this unless it revolves stripping, a bar, and
Heero as the only audience.<br><br>
"No."<br><br>
"Yes."<br><br>
"It's your fault"<br><br>
"I did it to help you."<br><br>
"...."<br><br>
"You."<br><br>
"...."<br><br>
"See, you put this leg in this hole here, and the other leg in the
remaining hole."<br><br>
"Not funny."<br><br>
"I agree, you might confuse the pant legs with the sleeve, I'll have to be
clearer."<br><br>
"..."<br><br>
"You owe me for the Christmas tree incident."<br><br>
"..."<br><br>
"And for the entire Wufei and Relena matchmaking episode."<br><br>
"Do you always talk this much when you're desperate not to do something?"<br><br>
"Mostly, want to find out?"<br><br>
"I'm waiting to see how long it would take before the sexual favors start
to pour in."<br><br>
"Pretty damn close."<br><br>
"Anything involving a football stadium and literal public displays of
affection?"<br><br>
"We don't have that long."<br><br>
"True, survival is thin at its best after this." (1)<br><br>
"So, you'll do it?"<br><br>
"No."<br><br>
"..."<br><br>
"Braid boy here..can't hide that?"<br><br>
"Scissors?"<br><br>
"Don't sound so hopeful."<br><br>
"Damn."<br><br>
"Yep, you're pretty much screwed."<br><br>
"Smug bastard."<br><br>
"Only the only way to be a bastard."<br><br>
"You're evil."<br><br>
"No, evil is an unconscious power. I do this to you intentionally. That
makes me cunning."<br><br>
"..."<br><br>
"How long do you think Hilde will buy this argument before we have to step
out there?"<br><br>
"Don't know, do try to continue please."<br><br>
"Why? You wear the red pants in the relationship, don't depend on me."<br><br>
"... Britney Spears lover."<br><br>
"Gasp! How dare you! That was below the belt and any form of dignity."<br><br>
"Sorry."<br><br>
"That isn't enough. Hilde! Heero's ready to play Santa now!"<br><br>
"Hate you."<br><br>
"Love you too."<br><br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br><br>
My kingdom for a camera and anything that's better for a camcorder! Heero
with a pot belly stomach and silver hair is to die for! The day that I
think Santa is attractive is the day I turn celibate but I might just have
to rethink that after helping Santa baby here change into his getup. Santa
works out.. wow.<br><br>
"For the record, I hate you all and I was forced into this so in case
anyone asks..." At the smug smiles on our faces, he sighed in defeat and
mumbled disjointed sentences about closing down restaurants and dancing on
our graves. I really couldn't tell, being too busy laughing.<br><br>
"Ok, so where do I go now?" He looked at Hilde, looking perfect in the role
of poster boy for misery.<br><br>
"Well, it's now a quarter to midnight, so we have around 15 minutes to
prepare for when Tommy will be awaken."<br><br>
"What more do we have to do?" I asked pointedly at Hilde, ignoring the
glares of Heero when I said "we"<br><br>
"Well, we'll have to try and get Heero into the chimney, at least half way
there so he doesn't have to show his face that much. Even with the beard
and wig, he's still too easily recognizable with those eyes."<br><br>
"WHAT?"<br><br>
If anyone can hear me up there, I forgive you for all the malicious jokes
you've played on me in the past, because this is just priceless..<br><br>
"Why can't we just dim the lights or something?" The closest thing I've
seen to panic appeared on Heero's face, and I would really love to feel
sorry for him but that's on my to-do list after laughing hysterically and
getting brutally murdered by a blue-eyed St. Nick.<br><br>
"Because Tommy's afraid of the dark."<br><br>
"Fuck."<br><br>
"Too late now, Heero, you should have offered when we were in the car."<br><br>
Is it so wrong to enjoy this so much?<br><br>
Ouch! Apparently it is.<br><br>
"Ok, get in! there should be enough room for you to squeeze in." With a
combination of persuasive words and forcefully shoving, Heero unwillingly
crawled into the old fashioned fireplace with only his lower body displayed
through the available space.<br><br>
"How's it in there?" As funny as this situation is to me, I still couldn't
help but be worried for the poor guy, doomed because he doesn't have a
braid to call his own. The worry was hinted at in my voice, making it one
of the reasons why he can't scream at me later or so I would like to hope.<br><br>
"Do they ever clean this place?" A muffled and irate voice was heard
followed by a great sneeze and several inappropriate words that makes me
glad of our first amendment rights and that we still have five minutes
before waking up anyone in the house.<br><br>
"Not since they moved in a decade ago." Said a cheerful Hilde and at my
disbelieving glare, she giggled.<br><br>
"Why do you even need him? Why couldn't you have just gotten two wooden
sticks and pretended it to be the legs? You really can't see the actual
Santa."<br><br>
"We need a talking Santa."<br><br>
"Why?" Despite the dust storm and filth that must be in that place, Heero
still asked the question that was circling above our heads. Curiosity might
not kill the cat, but it will certainly earn a few sneezes and interesting
threats.<br><br>
"Because...we need the ACTUAL Santa to reassure Tommy that he's got NOTHING
to do with ANNA NICOLE..." Stressing each word that she believed relevant,
I cringed at the emphasis she placed into her answer and I'm sure Heero did
too in his own little compacted space.<br><br>
"Hush! Here he comes!" Footsteps on the stairs accompanied by several
whines of "I don't want to" and "she's scary mommy!" alerted us of our
stations as we rushed towards the kitchen, making sure to leave a splinter
of light shining through from the living room. It was just to make sure
that everything's going according to plan but honestly, the majority of our
reasoning was just for entertainment purposes only.<br><br>
And to remember this for the rest of our lives or use to tease Heero
endlessly. Whichever comes first..<br><br>
"Ho Ho Ho! You caught me." Hilde and I were practically squeezing each
other to make sure that neither one of us explodes in uncontrollable mirth.
He just sounded so deadpan and miserable that it was almost endearing! I
swear, if I didn't know that that was Heero, I would have thought that old
St. Nick has given up on kids and was dealing with a major hangover!<br><br>
"Santa?" Though the view we were provided through the barely opened door
was small, the hesitant voice can only belong to Tommy with childish fear
prevailing above the surprise in his words.<br><br>
"Yes....." As if a second thought, a very long second thought, he continued
in that blank tone. "Are you happy to see me?"<br><br>
Meanwhile, Hilde and I were cradled in each other's arms while slowly
sliding down along the wall towards the ground, shaking in silent laughter.
Such a attitude saying these words were awkward to say the least and it
only created this irresistible urge for me to go in and hug the living
daylights out of the poor suffering guy who obviously has no idea what to
do.<br><br>
"Mommy... I'm scared." Tommy's voice was followed by various murmured
comforts that we couldn't perceive from such a distance away, but what
Heero said came loud and clear.<br><br>
"Well, are you scared because a..." he coughed at this point and I can
almost hear the amusement, or is it embarrassment in his voice? "big bad
man told you I was um.." Looking for the right words without actually
frightening the child with the scary name, he unfortunately came up short.<br><br>
"...a big bad woman in my spare time?"<br><br>
This oh so eloquent speech was followed by several loud sneezes which I'm
sure, shook the entire fireplace in a dust storm. However, the mental
picture of Heero's adorable performance with two visible red legs and the
rest of him hidden, accompanied by such a deadpan voice saying all these
uncharacteristic things is just too cute for words! A snicker escaped my
lips and quickly, Hilde's hand came to muffle my mouth but she too was
having a hard time controlling her own amusement.<br><br>
"Yes.. He was a very terrible and mean man." Tommy said, with a resolute
and accusing tone, implying in his words that Santa shouldn't visit the
big, bad Heero this year. The discomfited coughing that came from the
chimney only further fueled our fun in the sanctuary of the kitchen.<br><br>
"Yes, he was... and anyhow, it isn't true so you can go to sleep now!"
Finally some panic was sensed in the rushed words and I was getting a
feeling that he was truly going to suffocate either from the dust, or the
self-realization of what he was truly doing at that moment has finally hit
him on the head.<br><br>
"Go..now!" The urgency in his voice finally tipped the adults that it was
time to go quickly before something that was very painful descend upon
them. With lots of pushing and tearful goodbyes from a dedicated Tommy and
a curt grunt from his idol, they parted ways finally.<br><br>
...and all hell broke out.<br><br>
"Oh my god!" Equally tearful, we stumbled out of the kitchen supporting
each other and the laughter that has been bubbling inside us for the past
few minutes erupted with a vengeance. Neither of us realized the unfitting
quietness that was in the direction of the fireplace and to tell the truth,
nor cared because it was just too rich a moment to give up.<br><br>
After the commotion was calmed, Heero's voice finally disrupted our reverie
and called us back into the real world where he was still in the fireplace
and we were laying on the ground, weak from the aftereffects of the
laughter. All in all, not a very imposing scene.<br><br>
"I'm doomed. Today was destined to be the day from hell." He said in such a
grave and solemn voice that we couldn't help but chuckle again. Picturing
the displeasure in his face for not being taken seriously, I decided to
humor him. At least, after enduring tonight, he deserved that little
respect.<br><br>
"It's Christmas Eve, you're with friends, the night is still young
considering that we're us, and the rest of the night is dedicated to you
for being such a good sport. You've made one little boy very happy for the
rest of his childhood, and when we go back, we're going to make you a very
happy boy with tons of food, so what about this day is fated to end in "the
day from hell" now that the worse is over?" I asked, my amusement betraying
the supposed sincerity of my words.<br><br>
"Really...the rest of the night is devoted to me?" With his head in the
chimney, I can only sense the dryness in his tone.<br><br>
"Yes, it is."<br><br>
"Well then, get ready because I'm going to make sure that you follow
through on your words."<br><br>
"Be happy to. What do you want us to do?" Hilde, after finally gathering
enough energy to prop herself up on her elbows, asked while she wiped a
stray tear from her eyes.<br><br>
"Well, first of all, you can use this night to get me out of here." If
possible, the wryness in his voice became more evident.<br><br>
"Well, get out, get cleaned and let's get out of here!"<br><br>
"No, I mean get me out of here...literally."<br><br>
This was when we finally sensed in our clouded brains that something was
amiss<br><br>
"Meaning?"<br><br>
"I'm stuck.."<br><br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br><br>
Somewhere in another room upstairs:<br><br>
"Mommy, why is Santa still downstairs and what do the words he's screaming
mean?"<br><br>
"Go to sleep Tommy, it's only a dream."<br><br><br><br>
1. I got this line from Shella...thanks, I thought that was perfect! I'll
use the other quote you suggested another time. ^_^
