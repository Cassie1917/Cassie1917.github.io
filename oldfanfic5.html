<div style="font-family:VCR_OSD_MONO; color:#693459;">  Hello! After I read the reviews, believe it or not, I was laughing like
crazy at some of them. Thanks to those who has given me tons of compliments
because I just thought it was outrageously ironic that the same things that
I've said to other authors like: "I love your writing style, and I wish I
can write like that", "I took the time to read this, and now I'm late for
my homework, but it was worth it." Oh my god, you have no clue how I fell
to the ground laughing my ass off on that one. Trust me, if I can get one
penny for every time I dropped everything to focus on one story and then
paid for it later, then I'll probably be rich enough to really own the boys
though with my grades being so ignored, I will probably have to earn my
living this way. ^__^ It was so funny hearing someone telling me that
because the roles have switched in this case and I like the feeling of
that. Thanks for reviewing, it has made my day.<br><br>
Oh yes, thanks to eternal sleeper for the great idea! And to all those very
nice people who saw the flaw in why Duo didn't see Heero when he came in. I
actually noticed that, but was too lazy to do anything about it last
chapter.<br><br>
Also not as funny, but not my fault! I need to get the serious stuff out of
the way first before anything else!<br><br><br><br>Chocolate Covered Autumn<br><br><br><br>Chapter 5: We Meet Again<br><br><br><br>"Damn, damn, damn, damn" I mumbled sullenly and glared venomously at the
harmless, not to mention completely clueless plate I held in my hands,
reflecting on what happened yesterday. Nope, I'm no where near getting over
it anytime soon and this plate definitely feels my bitterness, or at least
as much as it can feel being an unfeeling object. I want to spread my
misery and make someone else feel terrible too.<br><br>
"Wufei, get your fat butt over here!"<br><br>
He nearly jumped at the sudden outburst. Not surprisingly because I really
didn't need to scream at him and especially since I was right next to him,
yelling directly into his ears can't possibly feel too good to his
eardrums.<br><br>
"MAXWELL!"<br><br>
"What?"<br><br>
"I'm less than two feet away from you! And if you would stop staring at the
plate, maybe you'd notice that!" The boy does have a point, I grudgingly
admitted, but the point of this conversation is to make me feel good, so
anything basically goes for that worthwhile cause.<br><br>
Looking defiantly back at Wufei's murderous glare, I bowed my head to look
down at my hands and walked away slowly, not saying one single word with my
head hanging low and footsteps heavy. Hazily, I heard a stunned gulp behind
me. This is very unlike me to walk away from a fight or anything that might
help me exercise my mouth and improve my skills.<br><br>
Yeah, go figure; some people take pride in playing the piano, the violin,
or any other instruments that are so burdensome to carry around and show
off to everyone. Art is another example. Can you really prove to someone
the expertise of your abilities if you don't have a canvas or paint?
Because it's obvious that the only good a talent does is to show it off. I,
on the other hand, am not only the only person that I know with my unique
gift, but I can prove to others just how good my talking skills are anytime
I want to. What can I say? I'm just naturally talented, but ignore all
those who say otherwise. It's not everyday that Relena threatens a person
to shut up or else she'd do unmentionables to their childbearing abilities.
I take that as the ultimate compliment.<br><br>
"Duo?" Wufei said to my retreating back hesitantly and received no answers.
No insults were hurled his way, and no smart ass comments were thrown about
how his unceasing rants are only to cover up his insecurities of his
manhood. In order words, he was scared as hell at my quietness.<br><br>
"....."<br><br>
"Duo!" The edge of uneasiness has crept into his voice and I can almost
hear him mentally sending his objections about this situation to the gods
and demanding why they didn't choose Quatre or Relena to endure this
torture instead of him.<br><br>
"You ok?" He probably had to muster up all his social skills just to say
that alone. It's so obvious that he was clenching his teeth trying to think
of what Quatre would do if he was under this circumstance. Nice try, but
next time, try not to sound so unwilling.<br><br>
I still didn't answer him. It was four minutes ago that I stopped speaking
to him, and that's almost a big red alert in the Duo scale. One minute of
silence was considered rare, two to four signaled that something was
seriously wrong, and above 10 minutes, well..they've learnt to run for
their lives. Hey, I didn't come up with the scale!<br><br>
I continued on my path outside the door and as the bell sounds acknowledged
my exit, I spun my head around to meet the nervous eyes of Wufei who looked
at me with a wariness that indicated his awkwardness at my unusual
behavior.<br><br>
"Your butt is fat." I said softly and in all seriousness before closing the
door behind me, just barely missing the view of Wufei collapsing on the
ground in shock, surrounded by the laughter that belonged to our customers.
I tried hard not to let a single hint of a grin come onto my face, but
needless to say, I failed miserably and as the door closed behind me with a
click, I started to laugh uncontrollably, recalling the priceless
expression on Wufei's face.<br><br>
Walking away with a cheeky smile that caused many peculiar stares, I waved
gleefully at those who looked at me as if I'm a fugitive from the asylum
and slowly stepped away from me when my gaze scans their way. My steps felt
lighter and my head more cloudless than in the past day until suddenly, I
heard the sound of the door opening again and a loud, indignant voice
called to me in the distance.<br><br>
"Maxwell! My butt is not fat!"<br><br>
His face automatically reddened as soon as he realized that in his rush to
correct me, he didn't notice the bewildered public who stared at him in
astonishment. He froze in place, looking back at those people and finally
settled at scowling at them to mind their own business. A little kid
hastily ran behind his mother to hide behind her dress at Wufei's foul
expression and his mother quickly grabbed hold of his hands, leading him
away while taking extra care to circle around the fuming Wufei. We honestly
have got to teach him some social skills.<br><br>
"Awwww! I'm sure Relena wouldn't mind!" My mischievous response if nothing
else, made him blush a deeper shade than before.<br><br>
"MAXWELL!!"<br><br>
"Be proud of who you are Wufei!" and with that last line, I scampered away
speedily, laughing joyfully all the while, before a justice ranting lunatic
decides to come after me and to choke me with my own braid.<br><br>
Not that I don't deserve it of course.<br><br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br><br>
"Let's see, I need chocolate syrup, pie crusts, and um..strawberry ice
cream." Maneuvering in between the busy customers in the aisles, around the
arguing grandmothers who were each pulling on one end of a cookie mix,
bypass the husband who looked completely out of place in the tampons
section. I had to practically jump over a little boy sitting among cereal
flakes who apparently decided that it was going to be an early Christmas
and unwrapped his first present of the year, a cereal box, digging his
hands inside to scoop out the prize within. Something tells me that it's
the only present that he's going to get this year.<br><br>
"Got that, got that, and finally....last but not least, mustard!" That was
my own little treat and I would go into all the lovely details of what I'm
going to use it for, but it's probably considered unsanitary and will
probably shock enough health inspectors in 34 states into having seizures
so forgive me if I don't go into all the fine points.<br><br>
Walking past the aisles humming to myself joyfully, my eyes drifted past a
glass bottle containing some sort of liquid and the notes died in my
throat. The bottle was a dark shade of blue, both mysterious and bright
when the lights above touch the surface to cast shadows in some areas and a
soft luster in all the rest. The contrast between the darkness and softness
of the colors reminded me of cobalt eyes that I want desperately to forget.
Looking at the surface of the bottle, the reflection of a long haired boy
with a large smile slowly turned bitter as the smile became strained and
eventually settled while memories flooded the mind.<br><br>
"It still has a long way to go before rightfully earning its name...."<br><br>
"I'm sorry Duo! It never occurred to me that he was the same guy that you
were talking about!" Relena looked at me sympathetically. "He came in a few
weeks ago while you were making a delivery... And I just remembered after
you showed me his picture.."<br><br>
"I'm sorry, but a million people can fit your descriptions of a blue eyed,
messy brown haired boy... It just never occurred to me."<br><br>
"But he's not the same as anyone else! You should have noticed him! How can
anyone not? Dammit!"<br><br>
"I'm sorry."<br><br>
"Damn him to hell."<br><br>
"The actual tastes are often veiled by the syrupy taste that can only
result from an excess of sugar..."<br><br>
How did I get into this mess? Why couldn't I just be perfectly content with
my life? Why did I have to have the urge to find this boy and to...ha, I
didn't even think past that! The only thought was to find him first when I
didn't even know his name.<br><br>
Now that I do know his name though, I wish I never did.<br><br>
Shaking my head clear of these thoughts, I placed the bottle back to where
it belonged and practically fled to the checkout lane, abandoning the
mustard for another day. It only took a few minutes before I reached a
solemn teenager hidden partly by the register. I looked closely at the
nametag that hung on his crisp white shirt where it was printed in dark
black letters: "Hello, my name is Larry, and I would love to help you."<br><br>
"Hello Larry." I nodded a greeting and apparently, "Larry" isn't as
cheerful or helpful as his overly optimistic nametag suggested. His lips
didn't even twitch and he maintained his "everyone owes me, and I hate my
mom for making me work here because I have to pay her rent" expression.<br><br>
"Whatever."<br><br>
After that oh so articulate exchange, the only sounds that were heard
between us were some slight clicks as he punched the prices in, probably
feeling bitter about it too, considering that a single piece of steak was
more than he can buy with one hour of "hard" work. I don't think I'll eat
that after I get home because he seems like the type of people who would do
something to it when the store manager isn't looking, and by the way he
stared at it sulkily, he probably did.<br><br>
Unconsciously, I started to hum again to myself until "Larry" looked up at
me with a very irritated expression on his face that immediately stopped
the second half of "I'm a little teapot" from escaping my lips. This guy is
like Wufei going through puberty..<br><br>
"Will that be all?" He said in an emotionless tone while his eyes strayed
to the door, fondly watching a group of teenagers smoking outside near the
parked cars. Nevermind, Wufei on hormones was never this bad.<br><br>
"Yes..Wait!" Temperately stunned, Larry's attention finally rested on me,
or the empty space where I was standing just a moment ago before I
hurriedly flew into the aisles again. I raced towards aisle seven, my braid
flying behind me until I finally reached my designated goal. Breathing
heavily, I grabbed the blue bottle from the shelf, and before I gave myself
adequate time to regret my actions, took off for the checkout counter once
again.<br><br>
"Here, I want this also." I said, my breath escaping me in short, haggard
pants while I took the time to tuck one loose strand of hair behind my
ears. He eyed me warily and didn't bother hiding his annoyance at me nor at
my hair when his eyes briefly skimmed my braid in a disgusted manner, his
face in an unhappy frown. I can just sense the questions in his mind and
I've just about had enough of his rude and obnoxious behavior by that
point.<br><br>
"Larry, or whatever you want to be called, I don't know much about you, but
I do know this. One of these days, you're going to get your ass kicked by
someone who is sick and tired of your sorry excuse for manners. I might not
be that person, but let me tell you, it would do the world good if someone
decides to do us that favor, and we'll be laughing all the while."<br><br>
The object of my threats actually didn't look too terrified, looking at me
rebelliously as if challenging a braided girly guy who in his eyes can't
possibly be much of a menace. Well, then, I'll just have to change that,
don't I? Gesturing to him, I requested for him to come closer. His
shoulders progressively tensed as he realized that I may not be as much of
a daisy as I looked. When he came close enough so that I can whisper to
him without any of the easily scandalized old ladies overhearing, I
continued my preaching.<br><br>
"Now, do you want to have children one day? If you do, you might just want
to be careful of what you do from now on, because I know a lot of people
who will be willing to change that just for fun and games. So if you don't
want to permanently sing a better soprano than any other females you know,
I'd suggest you grow up, or else, you'll never get to enjoy the benefits
that come after puberty."<br><br>
My voice was deadly icy and assured during the entire time that I was
whispering in his unwilling ears and in the corner of my eyes, I can see
that his eyes widened and his mouth tightened along with the rest of his
body as it grew rigid and stiff. I backed away slowly with a smirk on my
lips while he remained in that crouched position for a while longer before
he finally awakened from his bewilderment, but only succeeded in tripping
over his own two feet and falling backwards. I chuckled at his dazed
expression and my face returned to its normal cheery appearance, though I
don't believe he'll look at me the same way again.<br><br>
"How much is that?"<br><br>
"Um...that will be 34.50.." He gawkily straightened again and added
nervously, after hesitating a few seconds, "...sir..."<br><br>
"Sure, here you go." I said cheerfully as if nothing out of the ordinary
has happened and that I didn't just threaten a guy with castration a few
minutes ago.<br><br>
"Keep the change and have a nice day!" With that and a cheeky wave goodbye,
I was prepared to end my shopping expedition in high spirits, but only
managed to crash ungracefully into another shopping cart as I made a sharp
turn.<br><br>
"Oh, I'm sorry!" I apologized furiously as the owner of the other cart bent
down to retrieve a shopping bag that was knocked down at the impact. I
hastily bent down also to help him, and when I gathered the various
packages and reorganized them in his bags, I straightened again with the
his bag held in my arms, particularly careful not to drop anything. As his
eyes met mines calmly beneath his wild bangs, the emotions in his eyes were
carefully hidden in a deep sea of cobalt, and the lips that I've dreamed
about remained quiet. My jaw dropped and my hand came up to point at him.<br><br>
"Oh my god..."<br><br>
He raised one inquiring eyebrow elegantly at my inappropriate response to
him, a complete stranger. However, he was no stranger to me as I've spent
hours gazing into his picture sourly before I go to bed, with my mind going
through his words endlessly.<br><br>
"It still has a long way to go before rightfully earning its name...."<br><br>
"You're Heero Yuy!" I exclaimed loudly with a pointed finger at his face,
ignoring how rude I was being. His eyebrow was still arched at my seemingly
insane actions.<br><br>
"The bastard!"<br><br>
Well, if he was dubious before, now he's convinced that I'm crazy. In a
deep rich voice, he spoke to me for the first time and I don't think I'll
ever forget this moment, though what he said leaves much to be desired.<br><br>
"Are you mad?"<br><br>
"NO!" I shook my head frantically, indignant towards the person I was
facing, mixed with something that I'm trying to deny desperately. And yet,
among all the bitterness towards this man, I still can't refrain from the
great desire to explain myself. Somehow, I didn't want him to think badly
of me.<br><br>
"You are the food critic who wrote the review on A Little Piece of Heaven."<br><br><br><br>I realize that I sound like a complete dork right now, but hey, it cannot
be helped. Think of it this way. This is the guy who I've dreamt of talking
to in the past week or more, and finally, he is in my reality, flesh and
bones so to speak. How can I possibly act normal under these kinds of
circumstances?<br><br>
Ok, so I'm normally a dork, so sue me, I was in denial.<br><br>
"Yes." Unaware of the little dispute going on in my head, he replied
simply, looking a bit annoyed at my mindless babble.<br><br>
"You were wrong in your review." I'm a bit tongue-tied presently and this
single pitiful line was all that I was able to squeeze out.<br><br>
That definitely got him. Evidently, he's one of those people who take vast
pride in their work because the annoyance on his face only became more
obvious at my outwardly pompous opinions. I'm sure that if it was legal, he
would have whipped out a gun and shot me right there and there, senior
citizens with heart problems be damned.<br><br>
"I own that shop."<br><br>
Well, that has got to be the stupidest thing that has ever come out of my
mouth next to that one time in which I declared that I was a small rosebud
waiting to blossom. Don't ask. That was when I was going through an
identity crisis and had just recently realized that I liked penises other
than my own. Now, if anything, he'll think I'm this exceedingly conceited
chef who is overly sensitive about my art.<br><br>
"And that has to do with me how?" He said, still unruffled even though his
face clearly communicates his displeasure at being forced to face an idiot
who is completely ignorant, and that if there wasn't such an exasperating
person clinging onto him, he would have ditched long ago.<br><br>
Damn, can I describe how infuriated that knowledge makes me? I don't take
people who treat me like that well, proven by "Larry" who is behind me,
wearing a forced smile and saying ma'am and sir to every single person who
walks by, deliberately ignoring his friends who are staring at him weirdly
from the parking lot. At that moment, I forgot that this was the guy of my
dreams, or that I've been trying to stare at his ass for the past five
minutes because I really, really hate it when someone insults my confidence
about my own abilities in the kitchen, albeit unconsciously. It's the one
thing that I'm immeasurably proud of and this Heero guy is going to hear an
earful.<br><br>
"I know that you think I'm mad, or that I'm insane right now but without
knowing it, you are insulting the abilities that I'm proud of. You may not
realize that you are being offensive but it's not appreciated on any
degrees or circumstances. You may be able to insult me indirectly on paper,
but when it comes to meeting face to face, without your job as a cover;
your attitude towards your work leaves much to be desired."<br><br>
I unquestionably got his attention this time around.<br><br>
"Though I called you a bastard, which was uncalled for and I'm sorry, but
I'm still trying to give you my opinions from the point of view as the
owner of the shop you criticized."<br><br>
Heero's face didn't change its impassive expression, though his eyes
widened just a tad, an almost unnoticeable change. I ignored him and
continued on.<br><br>
"You probably take immense pride in your work, but keep in mind that you're
not the only one. I do too but you're belittling my pride with your obvious
annoyance of me. You might take pride in your work, but also, like you
criticized me for, you're not performing your job as well as you believe
you are if you are ignoring those that you've judged. If you can't accept
their opinions, then you have nothing to be proud of. I'm here asking you
for another chance to prove myself and yet you're too sure of yourself to
think that you may be wrong."<br><br>
He stayed wordless throughout my entire rant and though I feel as if I
should be embarrassed because I've just spilled out my frustration and
bitterness towards a person who has never seen me before, but it was too
late for me to stop. He looked down at his foot and I regarded him
silently.<br><br>
"Being a hypocrite doesn't feel very nice, now does it?"<br><br>
And with that said, I was prepared to walk away, knowing that my chances
with him were gone. However small it may be before, it doesn't exist
anymore.<br><br>
"Wait." A firm though slightly husky voice stopped my footsteps. I looked
back at the owner of that voice only to find him staring at me with a
determination and intensity that left me breathless and that I would love
to see in another situation, preferably on top of me, screaming my name.<br><br>
"Are you opened this Sunday?" My grin nearly spilt my face into two at his
question.<br><br>
"Yes, we are actually. From 9 in the morning to 8 at night. Should I save a
seat for you?"<br><br>
"Yes." And after a long pause, he added "Thank you."<br><br>
Can anyone blame me if I was grinning uncontrollably like a fool?<br><br>
"Trust me, the pleasure's all mine."
