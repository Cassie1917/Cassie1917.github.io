<div style="font-family:VCR_OSD_MONO; color:#693459;">  Hello! It's already chapter 4! I'm so happy! Thanks to all of you who
reviewed and surprisingly, enjoyed my sarcastic sense of humor. Poor Duo
though, suffering for my fun, but hey, he gets Heero in the end. Anyway, a
lot of bashing popular culture in this story, and this time, this chapter
isn't that funny. That's probably I didn't have as much fun writing it.
Review, Review, Review!<br><br>
Chocolate Covered Autumn<br><br>
Chapter 4: The Unforgettable Face<br><br><br><br>It's been a week since I lost sight of that cobalt eyed boy as he vanished
into the crowds of a mid-afternoon rush to get home and ever since then,
I've done just about everything in my power to see him except posting up
wanted posters on the streets. That's just a little bit obsessive and
immature, wouldn't you say so? Besides, Trowa and Wufei prevented me from
going to Kinko's that day to make copies of the description of him that I
made. I wasn't going to post them! I was just going to have them next to me
just in case anyone happens to have seen this guy. Of course, Trowa calmly
pointed out that "hot as hell, with a great ass" is not usually the type of
details that you use to describe someone you want to find in these kinds of
situations.<br><br>
Yeah, I realize that just about everything I do was pointless and
practically futile. Since that faithful day a week ago, I've abandoned
everything as soon as the clock hit 6:30pm, run out of the shop, and head
for Baker's Corner hoping to see him there. Sitting by myself or with
Relena, Wufei, or any other of my friends until the lights dim in the room,
the drink I'm slipping slowly turn bitter to my taste buds, and after my
hope suffers another severe blow, I'll finally walk up unwillingly and
leave. After that nightly ritual, all I want to do is hide from the
sympathetic gazes of those who know me so well, and seek the safe haven
that is my bedroom, curling up with Li' Duo to sleep the night away when I
desperately wish that it was someone else that I was holding in my arms.<br><br>
"Duo, you've got to stop this!" Ha, as if I didn't know that, but I can't
help myself anymore than I can refrain from thinking about him. No one has
shaken me like that on first glance before and I'm determined to find the
boy who has such power over me before he has even opened his mouth to
speak..or to do other things.<br><br>
Ok, that's also another issue, my libido has also been on overtime in the
past week and this sexual frustration is almost getting as worse as the one
between Relena and Wufei, but I'll learn better than to tell them that
though. I came back that day to find that my wallet has been taken apart
with my driver's license, my blockbuster's video rental card, my credit
card, and not to mention all my money shamelessly stolen. Well, does it
count as stolen when you actually know who the culprit or culprits are? And
besides, I eventually found all of them in various places that were very
interesting and original, to put it mildly. I had a fairly remarkable
conversation with the manager at Blockbusters about why I need a new card.
He didn't seem to believe my claim that my original one was burnt when it
popped out from the toaster along with the toast.<br><br>
"Blah!" Everyone looked at me strangely at my unexpected outburst.<br><br>
"I'm sorry, I needed that." I looked miserably at my foot while my
twitching fingers started to fiddle with the coins in the cash register in
search of something to do.<br><br>
Relena cast a worried glance to Hilde who mirrored the exact same concern
on her face. They dropped their chores simultaneously and walked towards
me, the troubled expressions on their faces informed me instantly that I
wasn't going to avoid this imminent lecture. They've tolerated my abnormal
behavior for quite some time now and though I'm thankful for their support,
or...maybe not. An image of Relena pulling on my braid to drag a howling
and reluctant me out of Baker's Corner just flowed into my head and my hand
instantly dropped the coins to snatch my braid, stuffing it inside my shirt
collar.<br><br>
"Duo, you've never met this guy."<br><br>
At my hostile glare, she quickly changed her previous statement.<br><br>
"Ok, so you've met the guy, like for one second!" Yeah, and that's what
I'm trying to change right now! You'd think she gets that by now!<br><br>
"Relena, I remember someone who used to have a, let's put this mildly,
fascination with Eminem." Trowa, quietly adjusting a light bulb commented
softly, his eyes never leaving the light above him, the angle of his face
conveniently covering up the little smirk that is twitching to expose
itself at the corner of his lips.<br><br>
Relena opened her mouth to speak but was interrupted further by Trowa who
apparently decided to compensate for all those times that he went wordless.
Go Trowa!<br><br>
"In fact, didn't someone come in every day and advocated endless about how
the poor guy was merely misunderstood in an ignorant generation who didn't
understand his genius?"<br><br>
A soft chuckle was heard in the direction of Quatre, who outwardly looked
as if his attention was wholly committed to the cleaning of the tables, but
like always, he was catching onto his lover's every word also suddenly
decided to help him out.<br><br>
"Yeah, I remember that too and how you would come in, looking grim and
depressed because as I quote: "no one understands him like I do".."<br><br>
By this time, the biggest grin that has been caught on my face in the past
week emerged from the obvious attempts of Trowa and Quatre to show their
support. Not to mention, they were reminding Relena of old and buried
memories that she would rather not reminisce but the rest of us have no
great objections to the contrary.<br><br>
"And how many times did you see the guy? Like..not on TV?" OHHH! That was
good!<br><br>
Now Relena was doing a very lifelike impression of the fishes that are
constantly on display in supermarkets with her eyes large and her jaw wide
open.<br><br>
Closed..<br><br>
Opened again..<br><br>
And now she shut it again...<br><br>
I think I need to call the news crew now, that has got to be the longest
that she has been found speechless. Well, maybe not, but the last time I
recall was when she had a duct tape over that troublemaking mouth of hers
and I was struggling with her death grip on my neck, trying to get the
phone back from me. Hey, what can I say? She was trying to set me up with a
"friend" of hers who happens to be in town, and most likely an ax murderer.
I could have sworn that I've seen his picture in the post office.<br><br>
"That's different.." Was all she managed weakly.<br><br>
"How?" Trowa asked with a bemused smirk that was threatening to break free
of his impassive fa√ßade. It was really quite obvious that he was struggling
not to fall down, laughing hysterically and that noticeable fact only
further served to disturb Relena more.<br><br>
"Ok, maybe it isn't so different. But I'm worried about Duo! This isn't
normal to fall for someone so quickly!"<br><br>
"So it's normal to fall for someone who was "misinterpreted" by everyone,
just not you."<br><br>
"Let's get off the topic!" Relena nearly screamed, flushed red from anger
and not at all from the humiliation brought on by the unwanted memories of
a youth so.. "misinterpreted"<br><br>
Ha, right, like even I'm gullible enough to believe that.<br><br>
"I don't know what are you people talking about, but I really need my six
therapists right now..." came a tired and worn voice from behind us that
instantly stopped the laugher echoing in the cozy room. We spun back to
direct our gazes at the door where a tall blond man was leaning against
the door of the shop, his usually bright eyes lacking its typical twinkle
but what stood out most of all was the apparent dark circles under his
eyes. How many hours of sleep has this guy been getting?<br><br>
"Zechs, what's wrong?" Relena, seeing her brother so exhausted and looking
so emotionally drained was temporary directed away from my problem, or more
precise, her problems, just like the rest of us who looked towards Zechs in
surprise.<br><br>
Zechs was possibly the best customer that we've ever had. The second he
heard that his precious baby sister was starting to work for a dessert
shop, he insisted to watch over her until he was sure that she was in a
good environment with good people. Well, he never did find that "good
environment and good people" but he more or less approved of us the way we
were which came as a total surprise because our first encounter was like a
warped episode of Will and Grace, though with more gay guys and less
makeup. Still, even after he felt completely reassured, he continued to
visit us frequently but it was no longer for his sister, but for my
cooking. It's something we always tease Relena with; that she got a job, an
extended family for her brother, and last by not least, had her reserved
place in his heart replaced by cherry pie and a big warm cup of coffee.<br><br>
"What happened?" Hilde asked while retrieving a small pillow from the
corner sofa and gave it to him, along with the special of the house today,
triple layered chocolate cake with a thin layer of strawberry jelly on top.<br><br><br><br>"It's Noin"<br><br>
What? Another good couple having problems? What's wrong with these people
today?<br><br>
We all looked at him patiently, knowing that if he wants to tell us, he
would in his own time.<br><br>
"Sorry for coming in so late, but I really needed to talk." He looked
defeated and yet among all that he is enduring right now, so determined to
stand up high again that I've just got to hand my admiration to him.<br><br>
"We're here, now spill!" I said with a great big smile on my face, not to
rush him but to show him that there is still something to be happy about
and that people are here, willing to listen.<br><br>
"Ha, knew that I can count on you." And a weary smile tugged at the edges
of his mouth which thankfully, eased the tightness previously found there
just a few moments ago. Although the smile didn't reach his eyes, I knew
without a doubt that if he lets us, it will.<br><br>
By this time, Quatre has came out of the kitchen with Trowa following
obediently with a steaming cup of hot chocolate topped by a generous
helping of whipped cream to compliment the favor. It was Zechs's favorite
and we've all commit to memory what our most regular customers, no, friends
need most during their time of forlornness, and trust me, Zechs's face
virtually brightened at the welcomed sight. He tasted the dark brown liquid
slowly and a grave sigh came out of his mouth as he collapsed completely
onto one of the loveseats near the window.<br><br>
"She wants a puppy dog" He said after a long pause.<br><br>
Excuse me? I think everyone's eyes enlarged at his seemingly random words.
What has all this got to do with a puppy dog?<br><br>
"A puppy dog was left at our door yesterday and as soon as Noin got her
greedy hands on it, she apparently couldn't bare to let the darling go.
Hn..women"..." He snorted at the revolting notion accompanied by the sound
of a loud slap on the back of Wufei's head after he snorted in harmony with
Zechs. Oh good god, this is so not the time.<br><br>
"Um....I'm almost afraid to ask this, but what happened?" Quatre said with
an awkward expression on his face, a guaranteed sign that he was caught
between the desire to laugh hysterically or to run away from the randomness
of this conversation. I can honestly say that I share his dilemma.<br><br>
"She told me that she wanted to keep it, just like a woman would!" That was
followed by another slap when Wufei, once again nodded his agreement. "I
resided strongly on my resolve not to keep it and now, you see me here. She
kept the dog, but kicked me out."<br><br>
I just blinked my eyes at him.<br><br>
"Why didn't you want her to keep it?" that was all I could think of asking
in my befuddled mind. And here I thought he was dying or something! I
should have guessed, my life isn't normal, so why should have I suspected
that this discussion was going to be? I was just about to throw my hands
into the air and walk away while I'm still in control of the little bit of
sanity left in me when Zechs interrupted with the final piece of his story
about the evil puppy that ruined his life.<br><br>
"Because I didn't think we were ready for it! We're not even married and
here we want a puppy? I mean, isn't it a bit quick for that?"<br><br>
I blinked again and this time, everyone else blinked in unison along with
me.<br><br>
"Dear brother, are you insane?" Relena inquired in the sweetest voice that
I've ever heard her use, dripping with syrup, before the fleeing sugariness
in her voice disappeared entirely and the degrees in the room felt like it
dropped greatly.<br><br>
"What the hell are you thinking? It's a puppy! You don't "get ready" for a
puppy! You get ready to buy a house, you get ready to get married, and you
get ready to ask someone on a date. Hell, you can wonder if it's too quick
to screw someone to kingdom come before you get married! But you don't
wonder if you have to tie the freaking knot to get a puppy!"<br><br>
Whoa, that was a bit disturbing. Zechs also seem to have the same opinion
as me because his eyes are now twice their original size, the spoon that he
was sucking on dropped to the corner of his mouth and his jaw opened in
shock.<br><br>
"Relena, I think you should come with me" Hilde whispered soothingly to an
agitated and tense Relena before hooking her arm into Relena's and tugged
her away from a frightened Zechs staring at her retreating back, mouth
still wide opened.<br><br>
"Don't worry, Relena just never got over her heartbreak when Eminem lost
that award for something or other. It's not that important." Wufei said to
Zechs consolingly and using one finger, closed the mouth that was
dangerously exposed to flies that seek excitement in the night.<br><br>
"I HEARD THAT!!" came from a voice in the back before another voice
immediately hushed her.<br><br>
"GOOD!!" Wufei shouted back to the kitchen where several colorful words
that shouldn't be meant for innocent ears was heard. He turned to us again
with a self-satisfied sneer on his face. I would normally scold him, but I
was too busy laughing my ass off.<br><br>
"Um..maybe I'll come back another day." Zechs muttered tentatively before
making an effort to rise from his comfortable position. He didn't get very
far before an emotionless Trowa pushed him back down again and looked at
him with a glare that instantaneously warned him of all the consequences of
getting up again.<br><br>
"It sounds to me that you're insecure about where you and Noin are going."
Trowa said coolly and looked to Quatre with an unspoken request in his
eyes. Quatre comprehended the look quickly and turned to Zechs also with a
comforting smile.<br><br>
"Yes, I agree with him. It seems like you're not sure where your
relationship is heading and whether you want to make the commitment or not.
This puppy is just an excuse for you to take out your questions on."<br><br>
I think Quatre should give me counsel from now on. I've been listening to
Relena too much and look at them. One's probably banging her head on the
pans right now and the other looks like he's contented in his element,
giving advice like a pro. Ok, that settles it. Tomorrow, I'm dragging
Quatre away from Trowa fro a second and mope to him instead! Of course,
knowing them, I'll literally only get a second of separation between the
two. Alas, nothing good lasts though I hope it does...<br><br>
And I hope it does with the boy that I've only met for one brief moment.<br><br>
"Don't think too much on it. If you're ready to make the next step,
whatever that may be, I'm sure she'll understand."<br><br>
Zech looked to us with a bewildered look on his face, absorbing every new
piece of information that he has just received, and finally, after a long
moment of silence, he looked down and timidly, he asked his last question
for that day.<br><br><br><br>"Am I ready?" His gaze stayed focused on his fingers which were nervously
gripping the pillow he held in his embrace. His knuckles were turning a
pale shade of white and even I can see how tense he is, awaiting our
answers. Did we have one ready for him though?<br><br>
We all looked at each other exchanging dubious gazes and as the quietness
dragged on, the more tightly he clutched the pillow. Quatre opened his
mouth once to speak, but closed it when no sounds would come out. I don't
know what got into me, but it was as if a single thought took control of
me, enabling me to reach out and touch his hand, gently releasing it from
the pillow that was suffering under the hands of its antagonist.
Looking at Zechs's uncertain eyes, I sensed his many questions and I smiled
encouragingly as an answer.<br><br>
"Do you love her?" He didn't even need to think about that before he nodded
with an obvious strong conviction towards his own reply.<br><br>
"Then isn't that enough to answer you?"<br><br>
He looked like someone has just given him a blow to the stomach as his eyes
widened for the countless time that day, watching me with shock that has
never been directed towards me previous to this day. I didn't think he
expected such a simple and yet, so absolute answer from me. It isn't that
hard actually. Things are only complicated because we make it so.
Comprehension gradually chased away the insecurities in his gaze and it
only further widened my smile when I realized that he understood everything
at last.<br><br>
"Thanks" And without another word, he sprinted out the shop with a hasty
wave goodbye and with the sounds of the bell jumping frantically following
his departure. For once, I thought that was one of the prettiest sounds
that I've ever heard in my life.<br><br>
"Good job Duo." Wufei put a hand on my shoulder and I looked back to find
him showing one of his rare smiles at me that was not caused by my usual
wise cracks or pity stories. Instead, in this smile, he gave me the respect
that he thought I deserved. All I could do was to return that favor and I
think my face just about spilt in two at the force of my grin.<br><br>
"Wait, he left something here!" The ever perceptive Quatre picked up a
magazine that Zechs left in a rush and glanced swiftly at it before
something caught his eyes and he gestured for me to go near.<br><br>
"Duo, I think you need to see this."<br><br>
"What is it?" Alarmed by the upset tone in his voice, we all quickly
gathered around Quatre, nearly crowding him in the process. Trowa reached
him the quickest and his arms automatically went around the petite blonde
in an unconscious effort to protect his lover. I would have gushed at how
cute the entire scene is if my eyes weren't glued on the page.<br><br>
"A Little Piece of Heaven is conceivably one of the most renowned dessert
shops in this city. Many of the sweets from the shop are served with a
generous amount of sugar, perhaps too generous as the actual taste are
often veiled by the syrupy taste that can only result from an excess of
sugar. Though this shop can easily gain the better of many of its
competitors, it still has a long way to go before rightfully earning its
name."<br><br>
After reading that little critique, my mind swiveled and I took an unstable
step back. I could not tear my eyes away from that little paragraph which
has just shredded everything that I've desperately tried to uphold in the
past two years. In a few short and brief sentences, I was regarded as
undeserving of the name that I've tried so hard to prove worthy both to
others and to me.<br><br>
"Who wrote that?" Suddenly, anger burned within me and I mentally damned
the person who wrote such a wounding review. My voice was shaky and my body
taut with the knowledge that someone out there not only destroyed the pride
that I've had in my work, but also shook the confidence that I've had in my
own abilities. This person not only made others doubt me, but also myself.<br><br>
"Let's see" Quatre said uneasily as he hurriedly searched the pages for a
certain name connected to this evaluation. My hands were tightened in a
painful fist and my brain completely blank, waiting for the murderous
thoughts of this name to fuel it.<br><br>
"It's someone by the name of Heero Yuy, there's also a picture here too."
Trowa said, also with a slight edge of awkwardness in his voice. Before he
could react, I snatched the magazine from his hands and stared at the
picture with an entrenched desire in me to burn the picture and laugh at
it. It really does sound charming.<br><br>
"This guy has no idea what he's getting into." I said bitterly before
finally resting eyes on the small photo on the bottom of the page, and as
recognition came too me, my breath was knocked out of me as if someone just
punched me in the stomach....hard.<br><br>
Staring at me from the page was a pair of defiant cobalt eyes framed by
locks of wild dark brown hair. While all the other photos were taken with
superficial or genuine smiles, his face remained vacant and emotionless.
This picture will burn into my memories just like my recollection of the
first time I saw him at Baker's Corner, before he disappeared in the
masses.<br><br>
Why did he have this effect on me? Why does he always manage to take my
breath away even without ever throwing a single glance at me? And why do I
feel so many intense emotions at the mere sight of him when he has never
even talked to me?<br><br>
And why do I feel so hurt by him when I don't even know him?
