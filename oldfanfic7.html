<div style="font-family:VCR_OSD_MONO; color:#693459;">  Hello people! I'm sorry for not updating in a long time, but let's just say
that there were a lot of things that I needed to take care of before
writing another one of my chapters. Such as college applications, essays,
SAT one and two.. Not to mention that I'm almost on my deathbed right now,
feeling so sick that it's almost impossible to realize what the hell that
I'm writing...^__^ But I'll try because I'm sure that many of you will be
wanting to read this (thanks for the reviews) but however, I don't think I
can keep up the speed I had writing the previous chapters. I'M SO SORRY! I
promise that I could after the college rush is over. And dammit, I don't
like writing essays for colleges, it's not really fun. If you get tired of
waiting for my updates, go read my other story! (shameless promotion and
stalling)<br><br>
Disclaimer: Realized that I didn't put one of these. Don't know, just don't
have the habit to, I guess. Anyway, don't own them in this chapter or any
other chapters to come. So if there's one chapter without a disclaimer,
then well...this goes for them. Also, I do own the plot of this story, and
taking this as your own would not be appreciated (glares) Be a nice person
and simply read.<br><br>
Chocolate Covered Autumn<br><br><br><br>Chapter 7: The Sweetest of Tortures<br><br><br><br>Morning: 10:45 and it's finally official. I am now completely and
blissfully blind. One can only take so many of suggestive smiles and
innocent touches as two accidentally bump hands or coincidentally walk
through the doorway at once, grinding past each other. Worse of all, I was
only the observer in this outwardly innocent game as the subjects of my
observations shamelessly make their time together count... though it is on
my time. Good God, as if the Brady's weren't bad enough, but now, the
Ricardo's join in the merry making. Quatre and Trowa are the red team, with
Relena and Wufei as the blue when both battle it out for the comforts of
the back closet every hour. The judge who is yours truly, just wants to
stab his eyes out with a pencil.<br><br>
"Ok! Dammit! The back closet is no longer available!" I screamed into the
masses when a giggling Quatre and a slightly hunched Trowa who had his arms
around the petite blond smirked smugly as they walked by the Ricardo's,
eyes challenging.<br><br>
"PEOPLE!" And the four who were running towards the closet as if their
lives depended on it suddenly froze in place and their battling hands
slowly loosened their death grips on the handle. Then, all of them spun to
look around me, eyes pleading on their pathetic faces, wanting "the boss"
to give them permission to screw around during work. Yes, I'm a very nice
boss but this entire episode just resembles something out of Sex and the
City, and since I'm not getting any...I don't think I'll really mind that
they don't either. I shook my head sternly at them with my lips pressed
firmly together and their faces, if it's even possible, became more
pathetic. However, I was able to sense the waves of amusement floating off
them at my frustration because they knew exactly why I'm frustrated..damn.<br><br>
For a brief second, I looked around me and pondered if it was humanly
possible to stab myself to death with eggbeaters and forks. I was almost
willing to try.<br><br>
"Duo?" The tentative voice behind me stopped me in the middle of planning
my own funeral. I was trying to decide whether it'll be more pragmatic if
held at the church, or where the cemetery is so that it'll be easier to
just dump me into the hole when they're done with the sentiments.<br><br>
"Yes?" Spinning around, I saw a fidgeting Hilde who looked as if she was
willing to be anywhere but here. I can't say that's a very good sign.<br><br>
"Um...." She squirmed even more as her fingers rested on her other arm,
looking down and avoiding my gaze.<br><br>
"Out with it." I crouched down in order to meet her downcast gaze, all
recollection of the other four forgotten as they continued to battle for
their territory when the boss turned his head. I should really set some
ground rules about washing their hands after coming out of there..<br><br>
"It's my cousin." The barely audible words slipped out of Hilde's mouth in
a rush and instantly, my head felt as if it was dunked in icy cold water
when unwanted memories of Lucifer's son came back with a vengeance.<br><br>
"He needs a babysitter tomorrow because his usual babysitter is not
available." A hint of desperation crept into the hurried voice of Hilde
when she noticed that the corners of my eyes were indeed, jumping at a very
disturbing rate.<br><br>
"And exactly WHY is that?" I asked through clenched teeth, my eyelids felt
as if they were going to win the record for most taps per second in river
dancing.<br><br>
"Um.... Honestly?" Oh no, that's not a good sign.<br><br>
"YES."<br><br>
"Her health insurance will not cover for her anymore on Tommy's babysitting
job; she's getting too many seizures and her doctor also recommended for
her that it's not good for someone of her age to be around Tommy
constantly."<br><br>
"How old is she?" Curiosity got the better of me as I inwardly sympathized
with this poor old lady who probably had to carry a cane around while going
up and down the stairs to find Tommy.<br><br>
"31."<br><br>
If looks can kill and mental thoughts can affect people in reality, Hilde
would be on the ground, regretting that she has ever brought up the topic
with me and Tommy..well, let's not get to Tommy shall we, but let's just
say that it involves several different groups of animals and all of them
heavy if not carnivores.<br><br>
"But you really can't tell by looking at her, she looks very old for her
age..." Hilde, taking in my darkening face, nodded furiously and looked to
me with big, pitiful eyes.<br><br>
"Can I just bring him to work for one day?!" Whoa.big, big pitiful eyes.<br><br>
"Wait, let me think... Two broken chairs, one customer covered in chocolate
syrup, the suspiciously large amount of ice cream missing, the beetles that
were found in the jam, and the bubblegum in my braid!" Thinking of that
less than pleasant memory and the hysterical laughter that haunted my
dreams, I had a sinking suspicion that I was going to be found dead in the
freezer tomorrow.<br><br>
"Please? Please?" Good god, she knows that I can't resist those eyes. I
will seriously hurt Relena for teaching that lowdown trick to her.<br><br>
"Fine!" And with that said, I grabbed my coat and prepared to head out of
the store for a very important mission.<br><br>
"Duo! Where are you going?"<br><br>
Without looking back, I slammed the door angrily and the bells started to
jump in harmony with the twitching in my eyelids. I screamed back into the
window.<br><br>
"I'm going to get some pepper spray!"<br><br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br><br>
This is the fateful day, I guess... I'm prepared at any time to scamper
under a desk and scream for the life of me: "Duck and Cover!"<br><br>
Or... "Stop, Drop, and Roll!"<br><br>
And my all time favorite that just about covers any circumstances,<br><br>
"RUN FOR YOUR LIFE! It's Armageddon!"<br><br>
What can I say? I'm prepared and at the store yesterday, I got pepper
spray, a fire extinguisher just in case ours wasn't working, or that we
needed two, a first aid kit, and the phone numbers of the hospital, 911,
and the fire station on speed dial. Then I gathered all of my friends for
an emergency run-through about the quickest escape route, how to perform
CPR when needed albeit I do think they've had enough practices with each
other.... and last but not least, how to use an assortment of kitchen
supplies as deadly weapons. Hit him where it hurts people! When Wufei
looked at me unbelievingly and asked if all this was truly necessary, the
other five pairs of eyes glared at him bitterly for his timely illness that
day. We seriously believe that it was because he knew Tommy was coming and
whatever lies he told us about whooping cough were no where near credible.
Everyone suffered under his hands that day and Hilde was scurrying around
for the week that followed the traumatizing experience to do us "favors" to
redeem herself. I think she's still paying for that customer's therapy
sessions.<br><br>
"Ok, we can do this! Bring him in!" Hilde obediently opened the door where
loud pounds can be heard being delivered to the poor wooden surface. In
popped hell with legs and a mouth that just wouldn't quit.<br><br>
"Hello people!" An innocent, almost angelic face looked at us with its
large eyes that are the color of the sea and a head of blond locks to
compliment the adorable image. Tommy has apparently forgotten that we've
locked him outside for around five minutes and that he's been punching the
defenseless door for the majority of that time. We weren't fooled by his
harmless façade though, knowing that he used the same trick on us last
time. When Relena bent down to coo at his cuteness last time, she ended up
staying in that same position for the rest of the day after he got a
horseback ride on Relena without asking. Everyone gazed at him guardedly,
even the ever so accepting Quatre with his eyes narrowed and his lips grim.
Well...everyone but Wufei who hesitated when the door opened, looking
shocked at the seemingly absurd procedures that we "crazy, child abusing
lunatics" have conjured up.<br><br>
"You guys, this is a harmless kid! What the hell were you so worried
about?" He shouted angrily at us and gestured to the demon who was still
doing his best impression of an angel. Wufei is so gullible at times.<br><br>
"After all the crazy stunts you guys have forced me through, it was all for
this kid?!" Shaking his head in annoyance, Wufei was prepared to give us
the lecture of a lifetime. Or he would have if a pair of small chubby arms
didn't suddenly wrap around his waist in mid-sentence, throwing Wufei off
balance. The next thing we knew, Wufei was on the ground in a heap with his
face kissing the floor.<br><br>
It looks as if the day has begun...<br><br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br><br>
"Yay! Isn't this fun, uncle Duo?" An exultant Tommy asked me as he played
jovially with his fingers digging into what looked to be a raspberry pie a
la mode before it was effectively stirred up into one pink blob by his
talented hands. I normally wouldn't mind that he was occupying himself with
something other than my braid, even as disgusting as this scene was but I
decided that his actions probably wasn't going to do me any good.<br><br>
...or the poor girl who's currently staring at the laughing kid playing
with what used to be her pie in shock, looking a bit too green for my
comfort. I had a hard enough time cleaning up that chocolate mess last
time, and I don't want to do anything like that again. Not to mention that
lawsuits were never my specialty.<br><br>
"TOMMY! HILDE!" I was at my wit's end and felt as if I was going to die
from frustration or at least become bald before I reach thirty.<br><br>
"Duo?" A timid Hilde walked by my side, cautious of the girl who looked as
if she's going to faint headfirst into that pink monstrosity.<br><br>
"Hilde...if you don't kick this kid out in one second, I'm going to fire
everyone and burn this place down." I said in a cool, controlled tone that
left no room for disagreement. Hilde and the others overhearing this
conversation gulped at the level of aggravation that I've managed to reach.<br><br><br><br>"Ha ha, Duo, you can't possibly be serious." Relena laughed uneasily,
trying to calm me down and change my mind about throwing her out into the
streets. It probably would have worked too if my favorite shirt wasn't
covered in the mustard that I've hidden for later use in the closet. The
only comfort that I was looking forward to after this long, long day was
now found on my shirt. Can you really blame me for being a tad bit pissed?<br><br>
"Fuck!" It was the only word that I found adequate enough to sum up the
situation I'm dealing with. But wouldn't you know it, this kid has a great
talent of picking up things he shouldn't.<br><br>
"What's that word, uncle Duo?" I froze at the outwardly innocent question.
A sharp gasp of exasperation was heard from Hilde and all of us were
perfectly aware of what's to come.<br><br>
"It sounds cool! What does it mean?" I inwardly cringed at Tommy's words,
seriously considering taping my mouth together for the remainder of my
sorry excuse for a life, or better yet, end it here. I would really love to
put that new set of carving knives into good use because I don't think
there's a better cause for using them than right now.<br><br>
"Fuck, Fuck, Fuck, Fuck, Fuck a Doodle Doo!" Tommy evidently has great
appreciation for the word of the day that was obviously different from the
other words his teachers are allowed to teach him. Words such as Box, Cat,
and maybe Dog. I can't wait until he tries to prove his new knowledge to
his fellow students. Oh god, is it such a sin to commit murder? I mean,
he's going to hell anyway so wouldn't it be better if... I don't know, help
him get there sooner?<br><br>
"Did I come at a bad time?" An annoyingly unruffled voice piped up behind
me. Fear and humiliation instantly paralyzed me. Of all the worse possible
times that Heero can suddenly surprise me with his presence and as
welcoming as that presence is, this has got to be the mother of all
humiliations. I'm covered in yellowish brown stains that looked similar to
what's behind bars in the shady streets of new York, my hair is escaping my
braid in disarray, and I look as if I'm about to kill anyone who comes
within five feet of me.<br><br>
"It's not Sunday!" I think I've noticed the trend of my speech patterns
around him. It's all the stupidity that I am able to muster up in me,
released in one single brilliant comment that is able to make everyone fall
flat on their faces at its lack of creativity.<br><br>
"I was in the neighborhood." He replied matter of factly as if he wasn't in
this room, wasn't here with my open jaw staring at him, and wasn't faced
with the knowledge that he needed a pepper spray. The bastard, he's not
human.<br><br>
Sensing my temporary inarticulateness, Relena came quickly to my rescue by
sprinting in front of me and blocking Heero's direct view of my dismay
expression. Her eyes though, silently warned him of all the miserable and
unthinkable actions that the little boy who's looking up at Heero in
childish wonder is capable of. Heero looked at her as if she was completely
insane but at the instant that Tommy cheerfully stepped near him, he backed
away as if bitten, seemingly finally realizing the devious glint in those
wide eyes.<br><br>
"Heero, it would be better if you left now and save yourself. Of course,
you can always stay and help us tie him up." With that, a maniac grin came
upon Relena's face which caused me to be slightly worried.<br><br>
Alas, the warning came too late as an undeniably annoyed Heero looked at
the chubby little fingers that tightened around the lining of his jacket. A
tugging match seemed to fail as Tommy's fascination to the jacket
multiplied tenfold along with the strength of his stubborn fingers. I can
almost see Heero's frustration at this unforeseen situation that is most
assuredly unwelcoming for him.<br><br>
"OH MY GOD!" Relena's eyes enlarged and multiple obscenities came from her
lips after Tommy's face cringed and his nose crinkled to produce the
biggest sneeze I've had the misfortune to ever see besides in MTV's
Jackass. The majority of it all ending up on the strategically placed
jacket in front of him.<br><br>
Ok, nevermind, all of it ended up on the poor jacket. Guess what he chose
to use as a tissue? Tommy, happily free of the annoying stuffiness in his
nose is being stared by a murderous pair of cobalt blue eyes. Blissfully
ignorant of images of nooses floating around the minds of everyone, he
wiggled his nose gleefully, rubbing it with his fingers before running away
quickly when the necklace of Hilde captured his short attention span of ten
seconds instead.<br><br>
Looking at me with a surprisingly tranquil expression on his face, Heero's
sight rested on me and if it wasn't for the slightly vindictive twinkle in
his eyes, I would have thought that he was in shock. Still, the air of
dangerousness that engulfed him intimidated me to edge back slowly, taking
Relena with me.<br><br>
He stood there as if he was a statue and then, almost mechanically, he
stalked towards Tommy as if he was a hunter hunting his prey. Can I tell
you exactly how sexy that image is? Like..really, really, really sexy.
Licking and panting sexy. Whoa boy, down.<br><br>
He walked to where Hilde was, red in the face and trying desperately not to
faint when a pair of hands pulled on the gold chain that cut off her air
supply. Dragging the squirming devil by the collar effortlessly, he yanked
a screaming and crying Tommy to where I was gasping at how quickly he had
Tommy under his control.<br><br>
"Do you mind if I had a little talk with him outside?" He regarded me
calmly, ignoring the little punches thrown his way and the curses that no
decent little kid of his age or any should know. But of course, knowing how
much of those have been directed to him, he must have learned during the
years.<br><br>
"No...not at all..." Staring at him unbelievingly, I'm sure I looked quite
the image of the composed restaurant owner but frankly, I don't care and
Tommy is getting what is coming to him surely. I can almost sense the evil
smirks that manifested on the faces of Trowa, Wufei, Relena, and even
Quatre, though it has always seemed impossible for him. I'm sure that Hilde
would have enjoyed this too if not for the fact that she has just collapsed
onto the sofa.<br><br>
"Good" Came the curt reply as a teary Tommy was dragged outside the door,
eyes quietly pleading for a helping hand, and not the few scattered claps
heard from all corners of the restaurant. I leaned towards Relena, wary of
the situation at hand.<br><br>
"After this, I'm inviting you to see Harry Potter." I quietly whispered in
her ear and her amused gaze rested on me, not at all surprised at my
seemingly random request.<br><br>
"Why Harry Potter?"<br><br>
"Because I heard that it was actually relaxing and they have good kids in
the movies. And let's not forget long..."<br><br>
"A bath is relaxing.."<br><br>
"But not as fun and not three hours."<br><br>
"How about sex then?" Her eyes turned devious when she purposely said the
question out loud as Wufei arrived with a mop to clean up the God knows
what on the ground that was from a trip Tommy took outside. Is that
moving...? Wufei nearly dropped the mop on the ground at her words which
caused Relena to giggle helplessly.<br><br>
"Sex? For three hours?" My eyebrows rose up to show my skepticism at her
suggestion.<br><br>
"Relena, I've been praying for that for my entire existence after I hit
puberty and it's still not humanly possible. Harry Potter is more appealing
right now."<br><br>
"Ok..you could do something else after the actual sex with the other
person" Relena jokingly punched me on the shoulders when I looked at her
disbelievingly.<br><br>
"Yeah, sleep, but that's always boring."<br><br>
"I believed that I said with the other person..."<br><br>
"Doesn't that person have to sleep too?"<br><br>
"What happens if it's two in the afternoon?"<br><br>
"I can go see Harry Potter afterwards." And with the words escaping my
lips, my mind conjured up images of Heero wearing a robe and riding on a
broomstick, not wearing anything underneath of course. When the wind gently
lifts the edges of that robe.. Oh god, I need to see that movie.<br><br>
"Sure, I'm sure you'll be busy tonight then, grab that person and have
fun." Wufei, we knew was listening to this conversation while appearing
uninterested, turned an interesting shade of red as Relena put emphasis on
how fun it is..<br><br>
"Wait, there's no other person." My face became unrealistically pitiful
when in actuality, my overly active mind is thinking up of plots of how to
make that Harry Potter fantasy come true.<br><br>
"Awwwww, I'm sure that there'll be someone who will be willing to have sex
with you."<br><br>
"Really..are you willing?" Positively wicked smirks appeared on the faces
of Relena and me when we became acutely aware of a choking Wufei behind us
and the entertained smiles of Trowa and Quatre. They were attempting to put
a little bit of order back in what Tommy has destroyed. Personally, I don't
think we can salvage those lava lamps anymore and I doubt anyone would want
to touch those forks after Tommy had experimented dissection using them as
operation knives.<br><br>
"Maybe... how about trying to convince me tonight, love?" And with a
sultry smile, winked at me and flaunted the slight swing of her hips as she
walked away into the kitchen, knowing exactly who was going to follow.
Wufei coughed a few times before running after her, not forgetting to glare
at me before hunting her down and closing the kitchen door in the meantime.<br><br><br><br>Ironic as one door closes, another opens and an encouraging sight welcomed
our eyes. A puffy eyed Tommy came in almost soundlessly, followed by a
stern looking Heero, eyes intense and... my legs are now made of rubber.
Thank you God<br><br>
"I'm sorry for the problems that I have caused today. I will never do it
again" Said a visibly unwilling Tommy with his lips pouting and his eyes
red. It's a sight that would break anyone's heart but alas, everyone in the
room were clearly sadistic or at least after how he has tormented us for
the past few hours, and the smugness prevailed above any little compassion
that we do have. My smirk, if possible, got even wider. Hell, I may be in a
complete mess and my face might frighten any children into having
nightmares, but I am feeling a lot better.<br><br>
"Heero, have I told you how much I loved you recently?" Albeit the joking,
there's always some truth and I might never get this chance to say these
words again. Heero's face looked stunned for a second, apparently
unprepared for these words though said in humorous tones. A small smile
emerged that was barely visible but I sucked it up like the pathetic, love
sick fool that I was. It isn't everyday that I get to make the person that
I'm heads over heels for smiling at me, especially a smile that was this
beautiful.<br><br>
"Not recently.. I wonder why." Heero's tone, though bordering sarcasm was
betrayed by the waves of amusement perceptible within his eyes.<br><br>
Smirking at each other, we must have looked like lunatics to passing
strangers as repulsive and unmentionable substances are visible on our
clothes and yet, the wicked smiles on our faces were wide and practically
identical.<br><br>
"Care to fulfill my dying wish.. or his, by telling me what you've just
told him?" Truth be told, I really want to know and if it works as well as
it looks, it might be pleasant to let Tommy in here more. I mean...he isn't
so bad and I get to torture him like he did me. Revenge is a bitch.<br><br>
"Nothing much." At my pointed glare, he struggled, the smirk never leaving
his face as his hand came to rest upon Tommy's shoulder, ignoring the
little cringe that shook the boy's body as he felt the touch.<br><br>
"I just told him what Santa does to bad boys." At that name, Tommy looked
as if he has just seen a ghost and his face turned an unhealthy shade of
white with his entire body shivering.<br><br>
"You mean give them coal?" Completely baffled, I had no clue how that would
affect Tommy to such an unbalanced degree.<br><br>
"Not that version of the story..."<br><br>
I see...<br><br>
"Anyhow, I think I should go home and change now." Disappointment hit me
sharply with the realization that he must leave. Yet at the same time, a
brilliant idea crept into my mind and I dare say it's the best one I've
ever had.<br><br>
"Heero, will you be willing to leave that jacket with me? I feel really bad
about what happened today and I would be willing to take it to the
cleaners." Not feeling at all guilty about the deceit that I was about to
pull, I gave him my most guiltless expression when he looked tentative
about my offer.<br><br>
"It's really no problem and if you don't let me do you this little offer,
I'll feel terrible for the rest of the night." Giving him a slight pout
that I learnt from Relena which rarely fails, I tried to convince him of my
sincerity. His eyes did soften at my fabricated earnestness.<br><br>
"You can pick it up tomorrow when you come." Score! I am bloody brilliant.<br><br>
"Fine." Turing around to take off his jacket, he revealed a loose black
turtleneck underneath that proved beyond a doubt that black was his color
and that I would love to scavenge for clothes in his closet. That boy has
good taste that's simple yet elegant, not to mention black and it's public
knowledge how I feel about that color.<br><br>
"Thanks, appreciate it." He said in a husky tone caused by the sudden cold
that attacked him, but it had the same affect on me nevertheless. I'll be
having good dreams tonight...<br><br>
As soon as he left, my eyes followed his figure as he disappeared behind a
mass of people, just like the first time I saw him with the exception that
I knew he was coming back. That has got to be the most comforting thought
in the world, to know that there's something I could look forward to when
waking up.<br><br>
"You're never going to give that back to him huh?" A soft chuckle was heard
to the right of me as the owner of the grin slowly walked into view. Quatre
looked at me with laughter within his sea blue eyes. He knows me all too
well, and before I've even nuzzled my face into Heero's jacket and smelled
the masculine scent of rich spices and the forest that is uniquely Heero, I
confessed Quatre's words to myself.<br><br>
"Unfortunately, the dry cleaners had a small accident..."<br><br><br><br>I did not reread this after I read it, and like I said, I have no time
right now to change it. This is probably the chapter that I'm going to
rewrite and revise some times in the near future. Sorry to those people who
were expecting something better... ( I promise I'll do better! Please
forgive me! The grammar and the spelling errors are terrible!
